# 3. Choose an Origin
Once you've chosen your character's species, it’s time to establish what they and their past look like. Your character also needs a name.

Your character's [culture](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Origins/Cultures/) describes where they came from and defines aspects of your character such as their native language.

Your character's [background](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Origins/Backgrounds/) describes their original occupation. The mechanical benefits of a background are:
* 2x +1 (stackable) to mental attributes that you consider your character to have developed as a result of this background.
* A background feature, which is a unique benefit based on your character's background.
* A package of starting equipment that your character possesses from their previous occupation.

Consider your character's appearance and how they behave. The colour of character’s hair, eyes and skin are yours to choose. Similarly, you can play a character of any gender without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender and sexual behaviour. Your character's name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. Consider how these characteristics reflect the character that you have in mind.

## Describing Your Character
Take your character’s attributes into account as you flesh out their appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds to a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.
