# Advancement
As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, they gain experience. Eventually, this leads to advancements in capability by gaining and spending character points, which can be used to purchase new abilities. Characters advance based on when they accomplish significant story goals in the campaign. The GM tells the players when their characters gain character points, which may be spent in the following ways:

| Benefit | Character Points |
|:-------:|:----------------:|
| Armour Proficiency | 5 |
| Defence Training | 5 |
| Defence Expertise | 15 |
| Defence Mastery | 35 |
| Increase an Attribute by 1 | See Below |
| Language (Broken) | 1 |
| Language (Accented) | 5 |
| Language (Native) | 15 |
| Learn an additional spell | See Below |
| Skill Training | 2 |
| Skill Expertise | 10 |
| Skill Mastery | 25 |
| Spell School Training | 5 | 
| Spell School Expertise | 15 |
| Spell School Mastery | 35 |
| Subskill | 1 |
| Tool Training | 1 |
| Tool Expertise | 5 |
| Tool Mastery | 15 |
| Weapon Training | 2 |
| Weapon Expertise | 10 |
| Weapon Mastery | 25 |

* Talents costs are listed in the entry for that specific talent.
* You cannot purchase mastery in a skill, tool, or weapon group, unless you are already an expert with that skill, tool, or weapon group. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to master is 37 points for a skill, or weapon group and 16 points for a tool.
* You cannot purchase a language at native level, unless you already speak that language at accented level. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to native is 16 points.
* You cannot increase an attribute score above 20.
* You cannot purchase expertise in a skill, tool, or weapon group, unless you are already trained with that skill, tool, or weapon group. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to expert is 12 points for a skill, or weapon group and 6 points for a tool.
* You cannot purchase a language at accented level, unless you already speak that language at broken level. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to accented is 6 points.
* When you permanently increase your Intelligence modifier or your proficiency modifier, you may spend additional points as normal. Proficiencies learned by spending points cannot be lost once gained.

## Purchasing Improved Attributes
A veteran adventurer may have trained or honed their natural abilities well enough to improve one of their six base attributes. While even the most determined development isnâ€™t enough to turn complete ineptitude into gifted competence, a hard-working adventurer can hone their existing strengths considerably.

The first and second time a that PC improves an attribute, it costs 5 character points and adds +1 to an attribute of their choice. The third improvement to their attributes costs 10 character points, the fifth 15, and so forth. Each improvement adds +1 to the attribute, potentially improving its modifier.

| New Attribute | Point Cost |
|:---------:|:----------:|
| 7 | 2 |
| 8 | 2 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 1 |
| 11 | 1 |
| 12 | 2 |
| 13 | 2 |
| 14 | 5 |
| 15 | 5 |
| 16 | 10 |
| 17 | 10 |
| 18 | 15 |
| 19 | 15 |
| 20 | 20 |

## Purchasing Additional Spells

| Spell Level | Character Point Cost |
|:-----------:|:--------------------:|
| 1st  | 2 |
| 2nd  | 4 |
| 3rd  | 6 |
| 4th  | 8 |
| 5th  | 10 |
| 6th  | 12 |
| 7th  | 14 |
| 8th  | 16 |
| 9th  | 18 |
| 10th | 20 |

## Stamina
Character points can be spent to increase your attributes. When your Constitution score increases, your stamina maximum also increases. Multiply your new Constitution score by your class multiplier to calculate your new stamina maximum. For example, if your warrior has a Constitution score of 17 and increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, then his stamina maximum then increases by 4 from 68 to 72.

## Starting Wealth
The Starting Wealth table lists the amount of treasure that each PC is expected to have at a specific number of talents, in addition to their starting equipment from background and class.

Note that this table assumes a standard fantasy game. Low-fantasy games might award only half this value, while high-fantasy games might double the value. It is assumed that some of this treasure is consumed in the course of an adventure (such as potions and scrolls) and that some of the less useful items are sold for half value so more useful gear can be purchased.
