# Generating Attributes
The following methods of attribute generation provide varying levels of flexibility and randomness.

## Low Fantasy
Roll 3d6, rerolling all 1s, and add the dice together. Record the total and repeat the process until you have six numbers. Assign these results to your attributes as you see fit.

This method is quite random, and some characters may have clearly superior abilities. This randomness can be taken one step further, with the totals applied to specific attributes in the order they are rolled. Characters generated using this method are difficult to fit to predetermined concepts and are best designed around their attributes.

If you don't like the idea of randomly determining attributes, you can use the **Low Fantasy Array** instead: 14, 13, 12, 12, 11, 10.

## Standard Fantasy
Roll 4d6. Discard the lowest die result and add the three remaining results together. Record the total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these totals to your attributes as you see fit.

If you don't like the idea of randomly determining attributes, you can use the **Standard Array** instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

## High Fantasy
Roll 4d6, rerolling all 1s. Discard the lowest die result and add the three remaining results together. Record the total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these totals to your attributes as you see fit.

This method is less random than Low Fantasy and tends to create characters with above-average attributes.

If you don't like the idea of randomly determining attributes, you can use the **High Fantasy Array** instead: 16, 15, 14, 14, 13, 12.

## Point Buy
Point buy allows you to build a character with a set of attributes that you choose individually. If your GM is using a point buy method, the point amounts and costs of attributes can be found below.

Your GM will tell you how many points you have to spend on your attributes. The cost of each score is shown on the Attribute Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 18 is the highest attribute that you can end up with, before applying racial increases, and 8 is the lowest.

This method of determining attributes enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones, a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal, or any set of numbers between those extremes.

If you will be using a point buy method, the following table shows the costs of purchasing attributes.

| Attribute | Point Cost |
|:---------:|:----------:|
| 6 | -6 |
| 7 | -4 |
| 8 | -2 |

| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 10 |

| Campaign Type | Point Budget |
|:-------------:|:------------:|
| Low Fantasy | 20 |
| Standard Fantasy | 30 |
