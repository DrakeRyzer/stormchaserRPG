# Travel Hazards

## Sickness
At the end of each day of travel, sickness makes an attack with a +2 bonus vs the Constitution defence of every character. If the party is travelling in hazardous weather (arctic or winter) or terrain (jungle or swamp) or somebody in the party already suffers from a contagious disease, then the attack has advantage. Remember that camp activities such as *Rest and Recuperate* and *Tend to the Wounded* help to negate this advantage. If you fail, record the failure. If you succeed, remove all recorded failures so far.

If you record two failures in a row, you come down with a minor sickness such as the common cold. More of an annoyance than anything else.

If you record three failures in a row, you get sick from a regional sickness such as flu or malaria. While sickened, you suffer from disadvantage to Dexterity and Wisdom checks until you recover. Magic such as lesser restoration helps you recover immediately.

If you record four or more failures in a row, you are really sick from a rare regional disease such as plague or dengue fever. While sickened, you suffer one permanent level of exhaustion until you recover. GMs may impose other risks, including death.

## Creating Hazards
The following rules let the GM quickly design and resolve blizzards, hailstorms, avalanches and earthquakes. Choose the appropriate tier for your party and the danger level of the hazard: setback, dangerous or deadly. Each hazard has an associated defence (usually Dexterity or Constitution) that it attacks. 

On a hit, the character takes damage appropriate for their level tier. On a miss, they take half of that damage. On a critical hit, follow the rules for a critical hit with an attack. On a critical miss, they take no damage. 

###### Hazard Attack Bonuses

| Hazard Danger Level | Attack Bonus |
|:--------------------|:------------:|
| Setback | +3 to +5 |
| Dangerous | +6 to +8 |
| Deadly | +9 to +12 |

###### Damage Severity by Level

| Character Level | Setback | Dangerous | Deadly |
|:---------------:|:-------:|:---------:|:------:|
| 1st-4th | 1d10 | 2d10 | 4d10 |
| 5th-10th | 2d10 | 4d10 | 10d10 |
| 11th-16th | 4d10 | 10d10 | 18d10 |
| 17th-20th | 10d10 | 18d10 | 24d10 |

### Hazard Examples

#### Avalanches, Rockfalls and Mudslides
*Any Level of Hazard*

The hazard makes an attack vs the Dexterity defence of any character in the area where the it occurs. On a hit, a creature takes bludgeoning damage and is buried by the hazard, or half as much damage on a miss. The area is filled with snow, rubble or mud and becomes difficult terrain.

Any buried creature is considered suffocated, and it can dig through to free itself. To do so, the creature must succeed a number of Strength (Athletics) checks, as shown in the following table.

| Hazard Level | Number of Checks |
|:-------------|:----------------:|
| Setback  | 2 |
| Dangerous  | 3 |
| Deadly | 4 |

#### Blizzard
*Setback Hazard*

The area affected by a blizzard is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the blizzard for one hour, the blizzard makes an attack vs its Constitution defence. On a hit, the creature takes cold damage, or half as much damage on a miss. If a creature is wearing warm clothing, the blizzard has disadvantage on the attack roll.

#### Earthquakes
*Any Level of Hazard*

A tremor shakes the area. The earthquake makes an attack vs the Dexterity defence of each creature on the ground in that area. On a hit, the creature is knocked prone.

The hazard level is determined by the proximity to the epicentre or the intensity of the earth tremor:
* **Setback.** Far from the epicentre or light earthquake.
* **Dangerous.** Near the epicentre or moderate earthquake.
* **Deadly.** Very close to the epicentre or severe earthquake.

#### Hailstorm
*Dangerous Hazard*

Similar to a blizzard, the terrain affected by the hailstorm is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the hailstorm for one hour, the hailstorm makes an attack vs its Constitution defence. On a hit, the creature takes cold damage, or half as much damage on a miss.

#### Insect Swarm
*Setback Hazard*

A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere. The swarm moves 20 feet each round. When a creature enters the cloud, the cloud makes an attack vs its Constitution defence. On a hit, it takes piercing damage, or half as much damage on a miss. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud is attacked again. A creature cannot be damaged by the insect swarm if it’s wielding a torch or if it is at least 5 feet from a fire. 

#### Lava
*Deadly Hazard*

The lava is considered difficult terrain. Any creature that enters the lava takes fire damage. A creature that ends its turn in the lava takes fire damage.

#### Lightning Storms
*Dangerous or Deadly Hazard*

The GM rolls a d20 to determine if any creature is struck by lightning. This check can be made at the beginning of each turn during combat or at any time while the party is not in combat. The creatures hit by lightning are determined by the GM, and any creature in the area under total cover from above cannot take damage.

| d20 | Number of Creatures |
|:---:|:-------------------:|
| 1-10 | 0 |
| 11-14 | 1d4 |
| 15-17 | 1d6 |
| 18-19 | 1d8 |
| 20 | 1d10 |

#### Magma Eruptions
*Dangerous Hazard*

Magma erupts from a point on the ground, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. The geyser makes an attack vs the Dexterity defence of each creature in its area. On a hit, the creature takes fire damage, or half as much on a miss.

#### Poison Clouds and Spores
*Setback Hazard*

The cloud makes an attack vs the creature's Constitution defence when upon entering the cloud. On a hit, the creature takes poison damage, or half as much damage on a miss. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud is attacked again.

#### Rapids
*Setback Hazard*

When a Large or smaller creature enters the rapids, it’s pushed 30 feet in the direction of the water flow. The rapids make an attack vs the creature's Strength defence. On a hit, the creature takes bludgeoning damage. Any creature caught by the rapids can make a Strength (Athletics) check to swim out of the rapids.

#### Rogue Wave
*Dangerous Hazard*

A large and unexpected wave that can be extremely dangerous. When a creature is hit by the rogue wave, the wave makes an attack roll vs the creature's Strength defence. On a hit, the creature takes bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a miss. The rogue wave, along with any creatures in it, moves in a straight line at a speed of 50 feet per turn, and any Huge or smaller creature inside the wave is attacked. The wave damage is reduced by 1d10 on each subsequent round. When the damage is reduced to 0, the wave ends.

A creature caught by the wave can move by swimming and it can make a Strength (Athletics) check to swim out of the wave.

#### Sandstorms
*Dangerous Hazard*

The sandstorm makes an attack roll vs the Constitution defence of any creature inside it. On a hit, the creature is blinded until the sandstorm ends. A creature can make a Constitution defence check at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The DC is equal to 10 + the sandstorm's attack bonus. A creature cannot be blinded by the sandstorm if it’s wearing goggles or something that protects its eyes.

Any check that relies on sight is made with disadvantage for the duration of the sandstorm.

#### Unsteady Ground
*Setback Hazard*

The floor in the area is considered difficult terrain. Any creature on the ground that starts moving on its turn while in the area must succeed on a Dexterity (Athletics) check or fall prone. If a creature uses a Dash action, it must make another check.
