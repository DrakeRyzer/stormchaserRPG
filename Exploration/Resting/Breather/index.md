# Breather
A breather is a brief period of rest, at least 10 minutes long, during which a character catches their breath.

At the end of a breather, a character can roll one recovery die and choose to recover stamina or mana.

To recover stamina, the player rolls the recovery die and adds the characterâ€™s Constitution modifier to it. The character recovers stamina equal to the total (minimum of 0).

To recover mana, the player rolls their recovery die and adds the character's spellcasting ability modifier to it. The character recovers mana equal to the total (minimum of 0).

After taking a breather, you may not benefit from a breather again until you complete a short or long rest. If you have taken two breathers since your last long rest, then you may not benefit from a breather again until you complete a long rest.
