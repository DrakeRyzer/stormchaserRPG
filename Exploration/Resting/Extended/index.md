# Extended Rest
An extended rest requires a week of downtime, usually at your home, base of operations, or other secure place where you can truly let your guard down and relax. Typically, this means touching base with your family, friends, or acquaintances and attending to your affairs.

An extended rest is required to recharge stronghold abilities and reset any accumulated death saves.
