# 3. Choose a Background
Once you've chosen your character's species, it’s time to establish what their past looks like. Your character also needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what they look like and how they behave. [Character Details](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Backgrounds/CharacterDetails/) contains helpful information for fleshing out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits.

Your character's [background](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Backgrounds/) describes where they came from, their original occupation and their place in the world. The mechanical benefits of a background are:
* 2x +1 (stackable) to mental attributes that you consider your character to have developed as a result of this background.
* A background feature, which is a unique benefit based on your character's background.
* A package of starting equipment that your character possesses from their previous occupation.
* 10 character points to spend on background talents, skills, tools or languages, as described below.

## Character Points
When creating a character, you gain 10 character points from your background and a number of additional character points equal to your Intelligence modifier. These points are spent as described in the table below:

| Benefit | Character Points |
|:-------:|:----------------:|
| Talent | Typically 5 |
| Weapon Proficiency | 2 |
| Skill Proficiency | 2 |
| Tool Expertise | 2 |
| Language (Accented) | 2 |
| Subskill | 1 |
| Tool Proficiency | 1 |
| Language (Broken) | 1 |

* You can’t increase an attribute above 20.
* Expertise requires proficiency. Mastery requires expertise.
* When you permanently increase your Intelligence modifier, you may spend additional points as normal. Proficiencies learned by spending points cannot be lost once gained.

## Your Character's Attributes
Take your character’s attributes and species into account as you flesh out their appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds to a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.
