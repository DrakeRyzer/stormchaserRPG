# 3. Choose a Background
Once you've chosen your character's species, it’s time to establish what they and their past look like. Your character also needs a name.

Consider your character's appearance and how they behave. The colour of character’s hair, eyes and skin are yours to choose. Similarly, you can play a character of any gender without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender and sexual behaviour. Your character's name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. Consider how these characteristics reflect the character that you have in mind.

Your character's [background](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Backgrounds/) describes where they came from, their original occupation and their place in the world. The mechanical benefits of a background are:
* 2x +1 (stackable) to mental attributes that you consider your character to have developed as a result of this background.
* A background feature, which is a unique benefit based on your character's background.
* A package of starting equipment that your character possesses from their previous occupation.
