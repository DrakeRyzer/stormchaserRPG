# 3. Choose a Background
Once you've chosen your character's species, it’s time to establish what they and their past look like. Your character also needs a name.

Consider your character's appearance and how they behave. The colour of character’s hair, eyes and skin are yours to choose. Similarly, you can play a character of any gender without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender and sexual behaviour. Your character's name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. Consider how these characteristics reflect the character that you have in mind.

Your character's [background](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Backgrounds/) describes where they came from, their original occupation and their place in the world. The mechanical benefits of a background are:
* 2x +1 (stackable) to mental attributes that you consider your character to have developed as a result of this background.
* A background feature, which is a unique benefit based on your character's background.
* A package of starting equipment that your character possesses from their previous occupation.
* 10 character points to spend on background talents, skills, tools or languages, as described below.

## Character Points
When creating a character, you gain 10 character points from your background and a number of additional character points equal to your Intelligence modifier. These points are spent as described in the table below:

| Benefit | Character Points |
|:-------:|:----------------:|
| Talent | 5 or 10 |
| Weapon Training | 2 |
| Skill Training | 2 |
| Tool Expertise | 2 |
| Language (Accented) | 2 |
| Subskill | 1 |
| Tool Training | 1 |
| Language (Broken) | 1 |

* Talents costs are listed in the entry for that specific talent.
* You cannot purchase expertise in a tool, unless you are already trained with that tool. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to expert is 3 points.
* You cannot purchase a language at accented level, unless you already speak that language at broken level. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to accented is 3 points.
* You may purchase only one subskill in an untrained skill. If you would purchase a second subskill, then the two points combine to grant training in that skill and you lose both subskills.
* When you permanently increase your Intelligence modifier, you may spend additional points as normal. Proficiencies learned by spending points cannot be lost once gained.
