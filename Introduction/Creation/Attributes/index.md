# 1. Choose Attributes
Start by generating your character's attributes. These six scores are your character's most basic statistics and are used to determine a wide variety of details and statistics. Some classes require better than average scores for one or more attributes. There are several methods to choose from for generating these scores so consult your GM to determine which method they are using.

Much of what your character does in the game depends on their six attributes: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom** and **Charisma**. Each attribute has a score, which is a number that you record on your character sheet.

The six attributes and their use in the game are described in detail [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/UsingAbilityScores/). A quick reference for what qualities are measured by each attribute follows below:

* **Strength** measures athleticism and bodily power.
* **Dexterity** measures agility, reflexes, balance and poise.
* **Constitution** measures health, stamina and vital force.
* **Intelligence** measures acuity, recall and analytical skill.
* **Wisdom** measures awareness, intuition and insight.
* **Charisma** measures confidence and eloquence.

|   | Physical | Mental |
|:-:|:--------:|:------:|
| **Power** | Strength | Charisma |
| **Finesse** | Dexterity | Intelligence |
| **Resistance** | Constitution | Wisdom |

Species modifiers are applied after the scores are generated.

After assigning your attributes, determine your attribute modifiers using the table below. To determine an attribute modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the attribute and then divide the result by 2 (round down).

| Score | Modifier |
|:-----:|:--------:|
| 1 | −5 |
| 2–3 | −4 |
| 4–5 | −3 |
| 6–7 | −2 |
| 8–9 | −1 |
| 10–11 | +0 |
| 12–13 | +1 |
| 14–15 | +2 |
| 16–17 | +3 |
| 18–19 | +4 |
| 20–21 | +5 |
| 22–23 | +6 |
| 24–25 | +7 |
| 26–27 | +8 |
| 28–29 | +9 |
| 30 | +10 |

The following methods of attribute generation provide varying levels of flexibility and randomness.

## Low Fantasy
Roll 3d6, rerolling all 1s, and add the dice together. Record the total and repeat the process until you have six numbers. Assign these results to your attributes as you see fit.

This method is quite random, and some characters may have clearly superior abilities. This randomness can be taken one step further, with the totals applied to specific attributes in the order they are rolled. Characters generated using this method are difficult to fit to predetermined concepts and are best designed around their attributes.

If you don't like the idea of randomly determining attributes, you can spend 25 points on the Attribute Point Cost table, or use the **Low Fantasy Array** instead: 14, 13, 12, 12, 11, 10.

## Standard Fantasy
Roll 4d6. Discard the lowest die result and add the three remaining results together. Record the total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these totals to your attributes as you see fit.

If you don't like the idea of randomly determining attributes, you can spend 27 points on the Attribute Point Cost table, or use the **Standard Array** instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

## High Fantasy
Roll 4d6, rerolling all 1s. Discard the lowest die result and add the three remaining results together. Record the total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these totals to your attributes as you see fit.

This method is less random than Low Fantasy and tends to create characters with above-average attributes.

If you don't like the idea of randomly determining attributes, you can spend 40 points on the Attribute Point Cost table, or use the **High Fantasy Array** instead: 16, 15, 14, 14, 13, 12.

## Point Buy
Point buy allows you to build a character with a set of attributes that you choose individually. If your GM is using a point buy method, the point amounts and costs of attributes can be found below.

Your GM will tell you how many points you have to spend on your attributes. The cost of each score is shown on the Attribute Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 18 is the highest attribute that you can end up with, before applying racial increases, and 8 is the lowest.

This method of determining attributes enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones, a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal, or any set of numbers between those extremes.

If you will be using a point buy method, the following table shows the costs of purchasing attributes.

| Attribute | Point Cost |
|:---------:|:----------:|
| 8 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 3 |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 7 |
| 15 | 9 |
|16 | 12 |
| 17 | 15 |
| 18 | 19 |

| Campaign Type | Point Budget |
|:-------------:|:------------:|
| Low Fantasy | 25 |
| Standard Fantasy | 27 |
| High Fantasy | 40 |

## Describing Your Character
Take your character’s attributes into account as you flesh out their appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds to a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.
