# How to Play
This is a game about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe and, like those games, is driven by imagination. It's about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that that scene presents.  

Unlike in a game of make-believe, structure is given to the stories. A way of determining the consequences of the characters' action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss, or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

Each player creates a character and teams up with other characters (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The characters can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters and discover fabulous magical items and other treasure.

One player takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), the game's lead story teller and referee. The GM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the entrance to Castle Morgenstern and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimise the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?

Then the GM determines the results of the characters' actions and narrates what they experience. Since the GM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, the game is infinitely flexible and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a **campaign**. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The characters grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the characters new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by a character's level.

There's no winning and losing - at least, not in the way that those terms are usually understood. Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes a character might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other characters can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

The play of the game unfolds according to this basic pattern.

**1. The GM describes the environment.** The GM tells the players where their characters are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the tavern and so on).

**2. The players describe what they want to do.** Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party. For example, saying "we'll take the east door". Other times, different characters do different things: one character might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don't need to take turns, but the GM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.

Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If a character wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. However, the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for a character to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.

**3. The GM narrates the results of the characters' actions.** Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.

This pattern holds whether the characters are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. However, most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.

Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM's verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood and many players and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.

## Game Dice
The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.

In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).

Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit and the other gives the ones digit. For example, if you roll a 7 and a 1, the number rolled is 71. Two Os represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20 and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71 and 00 and 0 is 100.

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, "3d8+5" means that you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together and add 5 to the total.

The same d notation appears in the expressions "1d2", "1d3" and "1d5". To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll a d4 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d5, roll a d10 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up).

## The d20
Does an adventurer's sword swing connect with a vampire or is it too fast and dodges the strike? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or do they take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.

Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six **ability scores**. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. For most characters, these typically range from 3 to 18. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores and the **ability modifiers** that are derived from them are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character's or monster's behalf.

Ability checks and attack rolls are the two main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. Both follow these simple steps.

**1. Roll the die and add a modifier.** Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically [the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/StepbyStepCharacters/DetermineAbilityScores/).

**2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.** A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.

**3. Compare the total to a target number.** If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, or attack roll is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks and attack rolls succeed or fail.

The target number for an ability check is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called a Defence (Def).

This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in play. More detailed rules for using the d20 in the game can be found under [Using Ability Scores](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/UsingAbilityScores/).

## Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes, an ability check or attack roll is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll an additional d20 when you make the roll. If you have advantage, use the highest of the rolls and, if you have disadvantage, use the lower roll. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If you have advantage on a damage roll, you similarly roll all the dice twice and take the better result.

## Specific Beats General
This game has rules that govern how the game plays. Nevertheless, many species traits, class features, spells, magical items, monster abilities and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: if a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

## Round Down
Generally, whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.
