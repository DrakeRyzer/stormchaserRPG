# Training
Given enough time, money, and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language, pick up proficiency with a tool, gain proficiency or even expertise in a skill, or possibly even earn a feat.

| Training | Duration | Total Cost |
|:--------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| Proficiency, Language, Subskill | 500 h | 250 gp | 
| Expertise | 1000 h | 500 gp |
| Mastery, Feat | 8,500 h | 4,250 gp |

Learning a new tool, skill, or weapon proficiency, or a language or subskill takes 500 hours. Sufficient learning resources to study alone should cost a total of approximately 250 gp.

Developing expertise with a tool, skill, or weapon takes 1000 hours. Sufficient learning resources to study alone should cost a total of approximately 500 gp.

Attaining mastery with a tool, skill, or weapon, or learning a feat takes 8,500 hours. Sufficient learning resources to study alone should cost a total of approximately 4,250 gp.

## Resources
Training requires you to first find a learning resource (such as a book) or a teacher who is capable of teaching you and willing to do so.

Books and other, similar learning resources must be bought in advance, but have the advantage of allowing a character to teach themselves in their free time. It takes a number of books with a value equal to the total cost of training to provide sufficient material with which to complete the training.

Personal instruction with a teacher who is able to assess the character individually and determine what would be the next step for them to develop and improve is significantly more effective. Every hour spent learning with a teacher adds two hours to the amount of time spent training. Training with a teacher typically costs 5 sp per hour.

It then takes a varying amount of time and money, depending on what you are learning.

## Resolution
At the end of each day, a character makes an ability check depending on their training:
* Training in a language calls for an Intelligence check.
* Training in a subskill calls for an ability check with that subskill's governing skill.
* Training proficiency in a tool calls for an ability check appropriate to that tool, as determined by the GM.
* Training proficiency in a skill calls for an ability check with that skill’s governing ability score.
* Training proficiency in a weapon calls for an attack roll with strength, or with dexterity for finesse weapons.
* Training expertise or mastery in a tool calls for an ability check with that tool.
* Training expertise or mastery in a skill calls for an ability check with that skill.
* Training expertise or mastery in a weapon calls for an attack roll with that weapon.
* Training in a feat calls for an ability check appropriate to that feat, as determined by the GM.

If you are proficient in the corresponding defence, you make the roll with proficiency.

Afterwards, consult the Training Results table. A natural 1 results in no progress for that day and a complication. A character that rolls a natural 20 may immediately roll again for that day, adding the result to the progress from the first roll.

###### Training Results

| Ability Check DC | Result |
|:----------------:|:------:|
| 9 or less | Your training falters, advancing only only half as much towards completion as the time invested in training. |
| 10-19 | Your training is adequate, advancing towards completion as per the amount of time invested in training. |
| 20-29 | Your training is exceptional, advancing twice as much towards completion as the time invested in training. |
| 30 or more | Your training is masterful, advancing three times as much towards completion as the time invested in training. |

## Complications
Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. For every 200 hours spent in training, or for each failure during resolution, a character has a 10% chance of a complication. Examples of which are on the table below:

| d6 | Complication |
|:--:|:------------:|
| 1	| You earn the ire of another of the teacher’s students. |
| 2	| Your teacher instructs you in rare, archaic methods, which draw comments from others. |
| 3	| Your teacher is a spy sent to learn your plans. |
| 4	| Your teacher is a wanted criminal. |
| 5	| Your teacher is a cruel taskmaster. |
| 6	| Your teacher asks for help dealing with a threat. |
