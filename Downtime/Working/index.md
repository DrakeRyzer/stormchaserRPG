# Working
You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 10 gp per week (see [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Expenses/LifestyleExpenses/) for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.

If you are a member of an organisation that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.
