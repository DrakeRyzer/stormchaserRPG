# Earn Income

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Downtime*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Applicable Skills:** History, Performance
You can use a [skill](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/) (typically [lore](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Lore/) or [performance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Performance/)) or [tool](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/) (typically [artisan's tools](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/Artisan/)) to earn money during downtime. You must be trained to do so. This takes time to set up, and your income depends on your proficiency rank and how lucrative a task you can find. Since this process requires a significant amount of time and involves tracking things outside the progress of adventures, it won’t come up in every campaign.

In some cases, the GM might let you use a different skill to Earn Income through specialised work. Usually, this is scholarly work, such as using [theology](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Theology/) in a monastery to
study old texts. However, giving sermons at a church would still fall under [performance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Performance/) instead of [theology](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Theology/). You also might be able to use physical skills to make money, such as using [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) to perform feats in a circus or [sleight of hand](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/SleightofHand/) to pick pockets. If you’re using a skill other than [lore](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Lore/) or [performance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Performance/), the DC tends to be significantly higher.

You use one of your skills to make money during downtime. The GM assigns a task level representing the most lucrative job available. You can search for lower-level tasks, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though this takes time and requires using the [persuasion](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Persuasion/) skill to Gather Information, doing some research, or socialising.

When you take on a job, the GM secretly sets the DC of your skill check. After your first day of work, you roll to determine your earnings. You gain an amount of income based on your result, the task’s DC and your proficiency rank (as listed on the table below).

You can continue working at the task on subsequent days without needing to roll again. For each day you spend after the first, you earn the same amount as the first day, up until the task’s completion. The GM determines how long you can work at the task. Most tasks last a week or two, though some can take months or even years.

**Critical Success:** You do outstanding work. Gain the amount of currency listed for the task DC + 1 and your proficiency rank.

**Success:** You do competent work. Gain the amount of currency listed for the task DC and your proficiency rank.

**Failure:** You do shoddy work and get paid the bare minimum for your time. Gain the amount of currency listed in the failure column for the task DC. The GM will likely reduce how long you can continue at the task.

**Critical Failure:** You earn nothing for your work and are fired immediately. You can’t continue at the task. Your reputation suffers, potentially making it difficult for you to find rewarding jobs in that community in the future.
