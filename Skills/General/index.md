# General Actions
While your character’s ability scores represent their raw talent and potential, skills represent their training and experience at performing certain tasks. Each skill is keyed to one of your character’s ability scores and used for an array of related actions. Your character’s expertise in a skill comes from several sources, including their background and class.

The following section details actions that can be taken which are applicable to multiple skills. When you use one of these actions, a skill is chosen based on the current situation, and any bonus or penalty you have for that skill applies to the roll for success.
