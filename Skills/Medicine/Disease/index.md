<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Downtime, Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Requirements:** You're holding or wearing a [herbalism kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/Herbalism/) (consumes 1 use)
You spend at least 8 hours caring for a diseased creature. Attempt a [medicine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/) check against a DC of 10 + the disease’s attack roll. After you attempt to treat a disease for a creature, you can’t try again until after that creature’s next check against the disease.

**Critical Success:** You grant the creature a +2d to its next check against the disease. Any check that you might have to make against contracting the disease from the sick creature benefits from the same bonus.

**Success:** You grant the creature a +1d to its next check against the disease. Any check that you might have to make against contracting the disease from the sick creature benefits from the same bonus.

**Critical Failure:** Your efforts cause the creature to take a -1d to its next check against the disease.

You can treat one creature at a time if you are trained in [medicine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/), or up to six simultaneously if you have expert proficiency.
