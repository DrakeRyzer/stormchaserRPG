You spend at least 8 hours caring for a diseased creature. Attempt a Medicine check against the disease’s DC. If the creature is proficient in Constitution defence, it may adds its proficiency bonus to this check. You can also spend another herbalist's kit use and make a medicine check against the disease's DC. If the check succeeds, the creature has advantage on its check and any check you might have to make against contracting the disease from the sick creature is made with advantage. After you attempt to Treat a Disease for a creature, you can’t try again until after that creature’s next save against the disease.

**Critical Success:** You grant the creature a +2d to its next check against the disease.

**Success:** You grant the creature a +1d to its next check against the disease.

**Critical Failure:** Your efforts cause the creature to take a -1d to its next check against the disease.

You can treat one creature at a time if you are Trained in Medicine, or up to six simultaneously for Expert proficiency.
