# Treat Wounds

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Manipulate*<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Requirements:** [Healer's Kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Gear/Descriptions/#healers-kit)
You spend 10 minutes treating one living creature (targeting yourself, if you so choose). Afterward, the target cannot benefit from the treat wounds action for 1 hour, but this interval overlaps with the time you spent treating (so a patient can be treated once per hour, not once per 70 minutes).

The [medicine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/) check DC is usually 15, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances, such as treating a patient outside in a storm, or treating magically cursed wounds. If you succeed at your check, you can continue treating the target to grant additional healing. If you treat them for a total of 1 hour, double the stamina that they regain from treat wounds.

The result of your [medicine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/) check determines how much stamina the target regains.

**Critical Success:** The target rolls 2dR to recover stamina

**Success:** The target rolls 1dR to recover stamina

**Critical Failure:** The target rolls 1dR and loses that much stamina.
