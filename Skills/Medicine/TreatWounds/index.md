# Treat Wounds

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Downtime, Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Requirements:** [Herbalism Kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/Herbalism/) or [Healer's Kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Gear/Descriptions/#healers-kit)
You spend 10 minutes treating one living creature (targeting yourself, if you so choose). Afterward, the target cannot benefit from Treat Wounds actions for 1 hour, but this interval overlaps with the time you spent treating (so a patient can be treated once per hour, not once per 70 minutes).

The Medicine check DC is usually 15, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances, such as treating a patient outside in a storm, or treating magically cursed wounds. If you succeed at your check, you can continue treating the target to grant additional healing. If you treat them for a total of 1 hour, double the Stamina they regain from Treat Wounds.

**Critical Success:** Target rolls 2 Recovery Dice to recover stamina

**Success:** Target rolls 1 Recovery Die to recover stamina

**Critical Failure:** Target rolls 1 Recovery Die and loses that much stamina.

# Long Term Care

#### *Downtime, Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Requirements:** [Herbalism Kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/Herbalism/) or [Healer's Kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Gear/Descriptions/#healers-kit)
If you tend to a creature for 8 consecutive hours, the next poison or disease attack roll vs its Constitution defence is made with disadvantage and its injuries are immune to festering. A creature can only benefit from long term care once in a 24-hour period. You can tend to one creature at a time if Trained, or up to six simultaneously if Expert or higher. You can't give long term care to yourself.

# Perform Surgery

#### *Downtime, Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Expert<br>**Requirements:** [Surgeon's Kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Gear/Descriptions/#surgeons-kit)
You can perform surgery to heal damage to a wounded creature, or to remove injury effects 5 to 16. Any of these operations requires at least 1 hour of uninterrupted work, at the end of which time you must make a medicine check. If you fail your check, the surgery does not yield any benefit (but any resources used are still lost). In addition, if you fail your check by five or more, the creature takes damage equal the character's Constitution bonus (Minimum 1) x the creature's level. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it dies.

**Heal Damage.** You can make a DC 14 medicine check to perform surgery on a wounded creature, healing an amount of damage equal to the character's Constitution bonus (Minimum 1) x the creature's level. If you fail the check, the creature instead takes damage equal to the same amount. If the creature was already at 0 hit points, it dies. You can perform Surgery on yourself to Heal Damage, but you have disadvantage on the ability check.

**Remove Injury Effect.** You perform surgery on a specific injury effect that a creature has, in order to remove or lessen the effect. Not all injury effects can be removed by surgery. Ask your GM if this is possible. To remove an injury effect, make a DC 14 medicine check. The procedure requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work and one use of a Surgeon's Kit. A creature proficient in Medicine can attempt to Help by spending an additional use of a Surgeon's Kit.

On a success, the injury effect improves. If the injury requires natural healing, it recovers twice as fast. If the Injury requires magical healing of a specific level or higher, magical healing of up to two levels lower achieves the same result. If the Injury effect lists a Constitution check, the roll benefits from advantage for the next week.

Once you attempt surgery on a specific injury effect, you cannot attempt it again for one week. You can however attempt surgery on another injury effect on the same creature.
