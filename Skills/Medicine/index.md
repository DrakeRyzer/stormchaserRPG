# Medicine
Medicine is a **Wisdom**-based skill that lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

## Diagnose Illness

* [Treat Poison](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/Poison)
* [Treat Wounds](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/TreatWounds)

## Resuscitate
**Proficient Only; Requires Healer's Kit Use**<br>
As an action, you can revive a creature that has just died. To revive the dead creature you must reach it within **1 round + 1 additional round for each successful death save the creature made before dying**, and succeed on a medicine check of **DC 30 - 5 for each successful death save the creature made before dying.** If the check succeeds, the creature is unconscious instead of dead. If the check fails, you are unable to revive the creature.

## Subskills

### Apothecary
Ointments, medicines and unguents are all different ways of solving what ails the common man who can't afford to down a healing potion whenever they get a headache. Being trained in the skill allows you to separate real cures from snake oil.

### Forensics
Looking at a battlefield and being able to determine which side won, where the victors went and who might have survived takes as sharp a wit as being able to look at a corpse and determine the cause of death. Such a skill can help keep the same fate from befalling the players.

### Massage Therapy
Physical therapy is not only a useful skill medicinally, but many a powerful ruler has had their ear swayed when they were in good moods during a skilled massage. 

### Veterinary
While many medicines apply in a general way between humans and horses, understanding the specific differences between the two can help you apply medicine to animals.
