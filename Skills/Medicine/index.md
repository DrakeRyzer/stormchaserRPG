# Medicine
A medicine check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

## Stabilise
A medicine check lets you use your action to try to stabilize a dying creature. This requires a successful medicine check of **DC 15 + 5 for every death save the creature has failed**.

## Diagnose Illness
If you spend one minute examining a creature, you can make a medicine check to identify a disease or poison affecting them. The DC is determined by the effect in question.

## First Aid
**Requires Healer's Kit Use**<br>
As an action, you can administer first aid to an unconscious or wounded creature. If you succeed on a DC 12 medicine check, the creature regains a number of hit points equal to its Character level, +1 for every point by which your check exceeds the DC. Using a Surgeon's kit grants advantage on your skill check. If the skill check succeeds, the tended creature cannot benefit from additional first aid until it takes new damage.

You can administer first aid to yourself, but you suffer disadvantage on your medicine check.

## Long Term Care 
**Requires Healer's or Herbalist's Kit Use**<br>
If you tend to a creature for 8 consecutive hours, the next poison or disease attack roll vs its Constitution defence is made with disadvantage and its injuries are immune to festering. A creature can only benefit from long term care once in a 24-hour period. You can tend to one creature at a time if not proficient, or up to six simultaneously if proficient. You can't give long term care to yourself.

## Perform Surgery
**Proficient Only; Requires Surgeon's Kit Use**<br>
You can perform surgery to heal damage to a wounded creature, or to remove injury effects 5 to 16. Any of these operations requires at least 1 hour of uninterrupted work, at the end of which time you must make a medicine check. If you fail your check, the surgery does not yield any benefit (but any resources used are still lost). In addition, if you fail your check by five or more, the creature takes damage equal the character's Constitution bonus (Minimum 1) x the creature's level. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it dies.

**Heal Damage.** You can make a DC 14 medicine check to perform surgery on a wounded creature, healing an amount of damage equal to the character's Constitution bonus (Minimum 1) x the creature's level. If you fail the check, the creature instead takes damage equal to the same amount. If the creature was already at 0 hit points, it dies. You can perform Surgery on yourself to Heal Damage, but you have disadvantage on the ability check.

**Remove Injury Effect.** You perform surgery on a specific injury effect that a creature has, in order to remove or lessen the effect. Not all injury effects can be removed by surgery. Ask your GM if this is possible. To remove an injury effect, make a DC 14 medicine check. The procedure requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work and one use of a Surgeon's Kit. A creature proficient in Medicine can attempt to Help by spending an additional use of a Surgeon's Kit.

On a success, the injury effect improves. If the injury requires natural healing, it recovers twice as fast. If the Injury requires magical healing of a specific level or higher, magical healing of up to two levels lower achieves the same result. If the Injury effect lists a Constitution check, the roll benefits from advantage for the next week.

Once you attempt surgery on a specific injury effect, you cannot attempt it again for one week. You can however attempt surgery on another injury effect on the same creature.

## Resuscitate
**Proficient Only; Requires Healer's Kit Use**<br>
As an action, you can revive a creature that has just died. To revive the dead creature you must reach it within **1 round + 1 additional round for each successful death save the creature made before dying**, and succeed on a medicine check of **DC 30 - 5 for each successful death save the creature made before dying.** If the check succeeds, the creature is unconscious instead of dead. If the check fails, you are unable to revive the creature.

## Treat Disease
**Requires Herbalist's Kit Use**<br>
Treating a diseased creature requires 8 hours. At the end of that time the creature makes a Constitution check against a DC of 10 + the disease's attack roll. If the creature is proficient in Constitution defence, it may adds its proficiency bonus to this check. You can also spend another herbalist's kit use and make a medicine check against the disease's DC. If the check succeeds, the creature has advantage on its check and any check you might have to make against contracting the disease from the sick creature is made with advantage. You can treat a creature's disease once every 24 hours. You can treat one creature at a time if untrained, or up to six simultaneously if trained.

## Treat Poison
**Requires Herbalist's Kit Use**<br>
As an action, you can treat a poisoned creature. The creature makes a Constitution check agains a DC of 10 + the poison's attack roll. If the creature is proficient in Constitution defence, it may add its proficiency bonus to this check. If the check succeed, the creature gains resistance against the next instance of damage it deals. You can also spend another herbalist's kit use and make a medicine check. If the result equals or exceeds the poison's DC, the creature has advantage on its check.

## Subskills

### Apothecary
Ointments, medicines and unguents are all different ways of solving what ails the common man who can't afford to down a healing potion whenever they get a headache. Being trained in the skill allows you to separate real cures from snake oil.

### Forensics
Looking at a battlefield and being able to determine which side won, where the victors went and who might have survived takes as sharp a wit as being able to look at a corpse and determine the cause of death. Such a skill can help keep the same fate from befalling the players.

### Massage Therapy
Physical therapy is not only a useful skill medicinally, but many a powerful ruler has had their ear swayed when they were in good moods during a skilled massage. 

### Veterinary
While many medicines apply in a general way between humans and horses, understanding the specific differences between the two can help you apply medicine to animals.
