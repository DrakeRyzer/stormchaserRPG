## Resuscitate

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** 2<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained
As an action, you can revive a creature that has just died. To revive the dead creature you must reach it within **1 round + 1 additional round for each successful death save the creature made before dying**, and succeed on a medicine check of **DC 30 - 5 for each successful death save the creature made before dying.** If the check succeeds, the creature is unconscious instead of dead. If the check fails, you are unable to revive the creature.
