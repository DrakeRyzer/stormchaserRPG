# Administer First Aid

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** 2<br>**Required Proficiency:** Varies<br>**Requirements:** You are wearing or holding a [healer's kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Gear/Descriptions/#healers-kit)
You perform first aid on an adjacent creature that is dying, bleeding, or sometimes even dead. If a creature is both dying and bleeding, choose which ailment you’re trying to treat before you roll. You can administer first aid again to attempt to remedy the other effect.

* **Stabilise (Untrained):** Attempt a [medicine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/) check on a creature that has 0 stamina and the dying condition. The DC is equal to 5 + that creature’s recovery roll DC (typically 15 + its dying value).
* **Stop Bleeding (Untrained):** Attempt a [medicine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/) check on a creature that is taking persistent bleed damage, giving them a chance to make another flat check to remove the persistent damage. The DC is usually the DC of the effect that caused the bleed.
* **Resuscitate (Trained Only):** You can attempt to revive a creature that has just died. To revive the dead creature you must reach it within **1 round + 1 additional round for each successful recovery check that the creature made before dying**, and succeed on a [medicine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/) check of **DC 25 - 5 for each successful recovery check that the creature made before dying.** If the check succeeds, the creature is unconscious instead of dead. If the check fails, you are unable to revive the creature.

**Success:** If you’re trying to stabilise, the creature loses the dying condition (but remains unconscious). If you’re trying to stop bleeding, the creature attempts a flat check to end the bleeding.

**Critical Failure:** If you were trying to stabilise, the creature’s dying value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop bleeding, it immediately takes an amount of damage equal to its persistent bleed damage.
