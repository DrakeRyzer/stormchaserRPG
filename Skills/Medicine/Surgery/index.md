You can perform surgery to to remove injury effects 5 to 16. Any of these operations requires at least 1 hour of uninterrupted work and one use of a surgeon's kit, at the end of which time you must make a DC 15 [medicine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/) check. A creature proficient in [medicine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Medicine/) can attempt to [aid](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Aid/) the attempt by spending an additional use of a surgeon's kit.

You perform surgery on a specific injury effect that a creature has, in order to remove or lessen the effect. Not all injury effects can be removed by surgery. Ask your GM if this is possible. Once you attempt surgery on a specific injury effect, you cannot attempt it again for one week. You can however attempt surgery on another injury effect on the same creature.

**Critical Success** The injury effect improves. If the injury requires natural healing, it recovers four times as fast. If the injury requires magical healing of a specific level or higher, magical healing of up to four levels lower achieves the same result. If the injury effect lists a Constitution check, the roll benefits from +2d for the next week.

**Success** The injury effect improves. If the injury requires natural healing, it recovers twice as fast. If the injury requires magical healing of a specific level or higher, magical healing of up to two levels lower achieves the same result. If the injury effect lists a Constitution check, the roll benefits from +1d for the next week.

**Failure:** The surgery does not yield any benefit, but any resources used are still lost.

**Critical Failure:** The target rolls 1dR and loses that much stamina. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 stamina, it dies.
