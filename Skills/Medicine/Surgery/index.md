# Perform Surgery

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Manipulate*<br>**Required Proficiency:** Expert<br>**Requirements:** [Surgeon's Kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Gear/Descriptions/#surgeons-kit)
You can perform surgery to heal damage to a wounded creature, or to remove injury effects 5 to 16. Any of these operations requires at least 1 hour of uninterrupted work, at the end of which time you must make a medicine check. If you fail your check, the surgery does not yield any benefit (but any resources used are still lost). In addition, if you fail your check by five or more, the creature takes damage equal the character's Constitution bonus (Minimum 1) x the creature's level. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it dies.

**Heal Damage.** You can make a DC 14 medicine check to perform surgery on a wounded creature, healing an amount of damage equal to the character's Constitution bonus (Minimum 1) x the creature's level. If you fail the check, the creature instead takes damage equal to the same amount. If the creature was already at 0 hit points, it dies. You can perform Surgery on yourself to Heal Damage, but you have disadvantage on the ability check.

**Remove Injury Effect.** You perform surgery on a specific injury effect that a creature has, in order to remove or lessen the effect. Not all injury effects can be removed by surgery. Ask your GM if this is possible. To remove an injury effect, make a DC 14 medicine check. The procedure requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work and one use of a Surgeon's Kit. A creature proficient in Medicine can attempt to Help by spending an additional use of a Surgeon's Kit.

On a success, the injury effect improves. If the injury requires natural healing, it recovers twice as fast. If the Injury requires magical healing of a specific level or higher, magical healing of up to two levels lower achieves the same result. If the Injury effect lists a Constitution check, the roll benefits from advantage for the next week.

Once you attempt surgery on a specific injury effect, you cannot attempt it again for one week. You can however attempt surgery on another injury effect on the same creature.
