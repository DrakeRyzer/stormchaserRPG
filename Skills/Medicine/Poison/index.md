You can treat a creature to slow the effect(s) of poison in their body. Spend one use of your [Herbalism Kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/Herbalism/) and make a medicine check against the poison's DC. If the target is proficient in Constitution defence, add its proficiency bonus to this check. If the check succeeds, the creature gains resistance against the next instance of damage the poison deals.

Through a careful mixture of medicinal plants and compounds, you are able to dilute the presence of harmful toxins and quicken a body's fight against them. After spending at least 10 minutes and three uses of your [Herbalism Kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/Herbalism/), make another medicine check against the poison’s DC. After you attempt to Treat Poison for a creature, you can’t try again until after the next time that creature attempts a save against the poison.

**Critical Success:** You grant the creature +1d to its next check against the poison. If they fail this check, they have resistance to any damage received as a result.

**Success:** You grant the creature a +1d to its next check against the poison.

**Critical Failure:** Your efforts impose –1d to the creature's next check against the poison.
