# Insight
Insight is a **Wisdom**-based skill that decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someoneâ€™s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

## Subskills

### Combat Sense
Everyone knows to take the high ground, but there are hundreds of battlefield strategies that can keep adventurers alive. Likewise, understanding that your opponent also knows these tricks is an equally useful tool.

### Empathy
A bard might understand how to make others see their point of view with a silvered tongue. Empathy will let you understand how someone else is feeling without having to press them as forcibly. A more subtle art, certainly.
