# Skill Checks
A skill check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for a skill check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every skill check, the GM decides which of the six attributes is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The table below shows the most common DCs.

| Task Difficulty | DC |
|:---------------:|:--:|
| Very Easy |0 |
| Easy | 5 |
| Medium | 10 |
| Hard | 15 |
| Very Hard | 20 |
| Nearly Impossible | 25 |

To make a skill check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success and the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means that the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.
