# Perform

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Concentrate*<br>**Actions:** 2<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained
When making a brief performance (one song, a quick dance, or a few jokes) you use the perform action. This action is most useful when you want to prove your capability or impress someone quickly. Performing rarely has an impact on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent checks against the observers, or even change their attitudes, if the GM sees fit.

When you use the perform action, it gains one or more traits relevant to the type of performance. The GM might change these depending on the circumstances, but the most common performance-based traits are listed below.

| Performance Type | Additional Traits |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Act or perform comedy | Auditory, linguistic and visual |
| Dance | Move and visual |
| Play an Instrument | Auditory and manipulate |
| Orate or Sing | Auditory and linguistic |

**Critical Success:** Your performance impresses the observers, and theyâ€™re likely to share stories of your ability.

**Success:** You prove yourself and observers appreciate the quality of your performance.

**Failure:** Your performance falls flat.

**Critical Failure:** You demonstrate only incompetence.
