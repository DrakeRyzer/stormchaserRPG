# Performance
Performance is a **Charisma**-based skill that determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

## Subskills

### Comedy
What's the deal with Orcs subjugating other races? Comedy is a great way to endear yourself to your audience. Of course the wrong joke to the right crowd could end very poorly. 

### Dancing
Dancing is a universal sign of civilization. From the smallest Halflings to the largest Giants, every race seems to have their own culturally significant way to cut a rug.

### Entertainment Mastery
You have mastered a form of entertainment appropriate to specific situations. When picking this subskill, select a style. You can take this subskill multiple times, selecting one new style each time. You can use this subskill to perform in a way that is particularly fitting to specific situation. If you use an instrument you are proficient with, you gain advantage to your skill check. 

* **Tavern Music** - jolly or rautious songs of simple nature
* **Ceremonial** - fit for weddings, funerals or other rituals
* **Storytelling** - telling great stories that inspire others
* **Emotional** - music that makes people laugh or weep
* **Concerto** - exquisite performance for the high classes

### Oratory
A booming voice, echoing through a large room, catches the attention of all. The oratory skill lets you say what needs to be said with a significant amount of panache.

### Pantomime
This is the ability to pantomime actions and have others understand what you're conveying, such as communicating with party members without resorting to whispering. The GM should set the DC according to how difficult that action would be to convey without any other items.

### Poetry
It's not for everyone but to the right target, Poetry is like the Massage skill for the soul.

### Singing
Functionally similar to playing an instrument but requiring an entirely different set of skills, singing is oft said to be one of the most difficult instruments to perfect.
