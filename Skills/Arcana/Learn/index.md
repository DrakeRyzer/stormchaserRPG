# Learn a Spell

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Concentrate, Exploration*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained
If youâ€™re an arcane spellcaster, you can use the [arcana](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Arcana/) skill to learn a new spell from the [arcane spell list](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Arcane/). The table below lists the cost of the materials needed to learn a spell of each level.

You can gain access to a new spell from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll.

To learn the spell, you must do the following:
* Spend 1 hour per level of the spell (10 minutes for cantrips), during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
* Have materials of the cost indicated in the table below.
* Attempt an [arcana](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Arcana/) check (DC determined by the GM, often close to the DC on the table below). Uncommon or rare spells have higher DCs.

If you have a spellbook, learning a spell lets you add the spell to your spellbook.

|:-----------:|:----:|:----------:|
| Cantrip | 10 gp | 10 |
| 1st | 20 gp | 11 |
| 2nd | 40 gp | 12 |
| 3rd | 80 gp | 13 |
| 4th | 160 gp | 14 |
| 5th | 320 gp | 15 |
| 6th | 640 gp | 17 |
