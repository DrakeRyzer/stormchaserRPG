# History
Your history check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

## Subskills

### Ancient Lore
Is that statue historically relevant to the people who made the dungeon you're in, or is it something that was added in a later age? Knowing who built things and why can give greater insight into how they can help you now.

### Appraising
Knowing the cut of a gem, the difficulty in casting a bronze statue, or the elegance of a wooden box, allows you to understand exactly how ripped off you're going to get from the merchants in town.

### Bureaucracy
A hero gains understanding of the ins and outs of governments, politics, and those who pull the strings behind the scenes. Players who train in bureaucracy long for the safety of dungeons. 

### Dragon Lore
Everyone thinks they know all about dragons, but the creatures are so prolific and create so many half-breeds that filtering fact from fiction is difficult. A smart hero would want to study them.

### Giant Lore
Uncertain which giant sitting in a circle is the leader? Can't tell a Storm and a Cloud giant apart? Perhaps picking up the Giant Lore skill would help your hero avoid these confusions. 

### Heraldry
You see a shield emblazoned *Party per pale or and vert, a dragon segreant sable*. Does it belong to the evil baron from the next county or the benevolent king in your debt? Knowing means the difference between being celebrated or captured.

### Humanoid Lore
Humans, Elves, Dwarves and the other races of the world have raised empires, toppled kingdoms, forged alliances, and broken them with each other.

### Law
Knowledge of the rules and regulations, and the consequences that will happen when your party members break them.

### Regional Lore
How old is Camwen? What are the laws regarding open magic in Beschcadik? Who is the consulate from Eldren in Khazak Akhor? Only a fool would go into a country without knowing anything about it.

When picking this skill, select a region from the campaign setting. You can take this skill multiple times, selecting one new region each time. Generally, if the world has only a few regions, each one would get an appropriate skill. If you have a great many regions, try grouping them. For example, in Arden the Sarameian Empire exists. The Empire includes the provinces of Saramei, Tanem, Rajan, and Xingong.
