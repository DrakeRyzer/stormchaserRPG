# Skills
Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six attributes. Each attribute covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an attribute. An individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Athletics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each attribute are shown in the following list. See each skill's description for examples of how to use it.
* **Strength**: Athletics
* **Dexterity**: Athletics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth
* **Constitution**: Athletics
* **Intelligence**: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Theology 
* **Wisdom**: Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Survival
* **Charisma**: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion

Sometimes, the GM might ask for check using a specific skill. For example, "make an investigation check". At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means that an individual can make checks that involve that skill with +1d. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual rolls a single d20.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Game Master might ask for an athletics check. If the character is proficient in athletics, then the character makes the check with +1d. If the character lacks that proficiency, then they just roll a single d20.

## Skills with Different Abilities
Normally, a skill is associated with a specific attribute. For example, intimidation usually uses Charisma. However, the skill check might reasonably be governed by a different attribute. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of attribute and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can use a different attribute. For example, if a half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, the GM might ask for an intimidation check using Strength, even though intimidation is normally associated with Charisma. Thus, the barbarian may add their Strength bonus to in place of their Charisma bonus to the intimidation check.

### Overrolling
When the exact total of a check is relevant (for example, when determining the quality of a crafted item), for every die in your dice pool beyond the first that makes the target DC, you gain a +1 to your final result. For every natural 20 beyond the first, you gain a +2 to your final result.
