# Sense Direction
## Proficiency: Untrained
Using the stars, the position of the sun, traits of the geography or flora, or the behavior of fauna, you can stay oriented in the wild. Typically, you attempt a survival check only once per day, but some environments or changes might necessitate rolling more often. The GM determines the DC and how long this activity takes (usually just a minute or so). More unusual locales or those you’re unfamiliar with might require you to have a minimum proficiency rank to Sense Direction. Without a clear view of major landmarks or the sky, you take –1d to checks to Sense Direction. This penalty can be negated if you have an item, such as a compass, specifically meant to determine direction.

- Critical Success You get an excellent sense of where you are. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you know them exactly.
- Success You gain enough orientation to avoid becoming hopelessly lost. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you have a sense of those directions.
