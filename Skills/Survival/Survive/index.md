## Proficiency: Trained
You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild.

| Survival DC | Task |
|:-----------:|:----:|
| 10 | Get along in the wild. Move up to half your overland speed while hunting and foraging (no food or water supplies needed). You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which your check result exceeds 10. |
| 15 | Severe weather attacks have disadvantage to attack your Constitution defence while moving up to half your overland speed. You may grant the same bonus to one other character for every 1 point by which your Survival check result exceeds 15. |
| 15 | Keep from getting lost or avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand. |
| 15 | Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which your Survival check result exceeds 15, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance. |

> ### Surface Types
> * **Very Soft Ground:** Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.
> * **Soft Ground:** Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.
> * **Firm Ground:** Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.
> * **Hard Ground:** Any surface that doesnâ€™t hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles).
