## Subskills

### Find Water
It's recommended players take time to drink a few times in an adventuring day. In some of the more dangerous regions of the world that can be hard to do. Being trained to find water can help mitigate this risk.

### Fire Mastery
Something even children are taught and one of the basics of survival, you know how to start, stop, or enlarge a fire. Also, you can easily determine how long a fire has been burning.

### Fishing
Let others eat berries. Find yourself some of that delicious flaky food. A staple in any port location, many adventurers will supplement their dried foods with fish.

### Foraging
No water nearby? Can't hunt because the animals in the forest belong to the king and his evil henchmen? If you're going to end up eating berries, it's a good idea to know the difference between the ones that will make you feel better and the ones that will leave you sick.

### Region Navigation
Can't see the forest for the trees? Finding the Underdark keeps twisting around in circles? An ocean all around you and no idea where you are? Take some time to learn how to navigate the world and never feel lost again. When picking this skill, select a region from the Regional Lore expertise. You can take this skill multiple times, selecting a new region each time.

### Rope Mastery
You might not want to kill your foes, but they certainly can't be allowed to walk around freely. Why not tie them up with a rope? Or tie off a rope as an impromptu ladder for those times you're in the dungeon and a ladder cannot be found.

### Skinning
Animals need to be skinned before becoming the leather armour that ends up protecting your more lightly armoured friends and warming more northern peoples.  It is recommended for GMs to set the DC based on how difficult removal is and to reward failures with lower yields.

### Tracking
Not everyone can be so lucky as to track foes through wet mud or snow. Being skilled in spotting the tell-tale signs of your prey through the best and worst of conditions is useful to most adventuring groups.

### Trapping
If the whole 'slowly chase animals and shoot them with arrows' thing isn't working for you, try luring them with some bait into a trap! It is advised that the GM sets the DC based on how plentiful creatures are in the area.

### Weather Sense
Storm's a brewin' and you can tell! Know what the weather will be like in a few hours or even a few days, if you're really good at it.
