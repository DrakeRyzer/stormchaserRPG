# Survival
The GM might ask you to make a survival check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

## Follow Tracks
To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow. If you are not proficient in this skill, you can make Wisdom checks to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the Perception skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature’s passage using the same DCs, but you can’t use Perception to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.

You move at half your normal speed while following tracks (or at your normal speed with disadvantage on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions.

For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.

| Condition | DC |
|:---------:|:--:|
| Very soft ground | 5 |
| Soft ground | 10 |
| Firm ground | 15 |
| Hard ground | 20 |
| Every three creatures in the group being tracked | –1 |
| Fine creature | +8 |
| Diminutive creature | +4 |
| Tiny creature | +2 |
| Small creature | +1 |
| Medium creature | +0 |
| Large creature | –1 |
| Huge creature | –2 |
| Gargantuan creature | –4 |
| Colossal creature | –8 |
| Every 24 hours since the trail was made | +1 |
| Every hour of rain since the trail was made | +1 |
| Fresh snow since the trail was made | +10 |
| Overcast or moonless night | +6 |
| Moonlight | +3 |
| Fog or precipitation | +3 |
| Tracked party hides trail (and moves at half speed) | +5 |

For a group of mixed sizes, apply only the modifier for the largest size category.

For visibility, apply only the largest modifier of this type.

## Survive in the Wilderness
You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild.

| Survival DC | Task |
|:-----------:|:----:|
| 10 | Get along in the wild. Move up to half your overland speed while hunting and foraging (no food or water supplies needed). You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which your check result exceeds 10. |
| 15 | Severe weather attacks have disadvantage to attack your Constitution defence while moving up to half your overland speed. You may grant the same bonus to one other character for every 1 point by which your Survival check result exceeds 15. |
| 15 | Keep from getting lost or avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand. |
| 15 | Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which your Survival check result exceeds 15, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance. |

> ### Surface Types
> * **Very Soft Ground:** Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.
> * **Soft Ground:** Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.
> * **Firm Ground:** Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.
> * **Hard Ground:** Any surface that doesn’t hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles).

## Subskills

### Find Water
It's recommended players take time to drink a few times in an adventuring day. In some of the more dangerous regions of the world that can be hard to do. Being trained to find water can help mitigate this risk.

### Fire Mastery
Something even children are taught and one of the basics of survival, you know how to start, stop, or enlarge a fire. Also, you can easily determine how long a fire has been burning.

### Fishing
Let others eat berries. Find yourself some of that delicious flaky food. A staple in any port location, many adventurers will supplement their dried foods with fish.

### Foraging
No water nearby? Can't hunt because the animals in the forest belong to the king and his evil henchmen? If you're going to end up eating berries, it's a good idea to know the difference between the ones that will make you feel better and the ones that will leave you sick.

### Region Navigation
Can't see the forest for the trees? Finding the Underdark keeps twisting around in circles? An ocean all around you and no idea where you are? Take some time to learn how to navigate the world and never feel lost again. When picking this skill, select a region from the Regional Lore expertise. You can take this skill multiple times, selecting a new region each time.

### Rope Mastery
You might not want to kill your foes, but they certainly can't be allowed to walk around freely. Why not tie them up with a rope? Or tie off a rope as an impromptu ladder for those times you're in the dungeon and a ladder cannot be found.

### Skinning
Animals need to be skinned before becoming the leather armour that ends up protecting your more lightly armoured friends and warming more northern peoples.  It is recommended for GMs to set the DC based on how difficult removal is and to reward failures with lower yields.

### Tracking
Not everyone can be so lucky as to track foes through wet mud or snow. Being skilled in spotting the tell-tale signs of your prey through the best and worst of conditions is useful to most adventuring groups.

### Trapping
If the whole 'slowly chase animals and shoot them with arrows' thing isn't working for you, try luring them with some bait into a trap! It is advised that the GM sets the DC based on how plentiful creatures are in the area.

### Weather Sense
Storm's a brewin' and you can tell! Know what the weather will be like in a few hours or even a few days, if you're really good at it.
