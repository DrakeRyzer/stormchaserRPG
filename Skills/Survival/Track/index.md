# Track

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Concentrate, Exploration, Move*<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained
To find tracks or to follow them for 1 hour requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow. If you are not proficient in this skill, you can make Wisdom checks to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use [Perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/) to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature’s passage using the same DCs, but you can’t use [Perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/) to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.

You move at half your normal speed while following tracks (or at your normal speed with -1d on the check).

In some cases, you might Track in an encounter. In this case, Track is a single action and doesn’t have the exploration trait, but you might need to roll more often because you’re in a tense situation. The GM determines how often you must attempt this check.

You attempt your Survival check when you start Tracking, once every hour you continue tracking, and any time something significant changes in the trail. The GM determines the DCs for such checks, depending on the freshness of the trail, the weather, and the type of ground.

**Success:** You find the trail, or continue to follow the one that you're already following.

**Failure:** You lose the trail but can try again after a 1-hour (outdoors), or 10 minutes (indoors) delay.

**Critical Failure:** You lose the trail and can’t try again for 24 hours (outdoors), or 8 hours (indoors).
