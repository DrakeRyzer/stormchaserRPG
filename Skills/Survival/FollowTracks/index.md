# Follow Tracks
## Proficiency: Trained
To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow. If you are not proficient in this skill, you can make Wisdom checks to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the Perception skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature’s passage using the same DCs, but you can’t use Perception to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.

You move at half your normal speed while following tracks (or at your normal speed with disadvantage on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions.

For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.
