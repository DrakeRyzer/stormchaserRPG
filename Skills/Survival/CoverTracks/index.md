# Cover Tracks
## Proficiency: Trained
You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel speed. You donâ€™t need to attempt a Survival check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Follow Track.

In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action.
