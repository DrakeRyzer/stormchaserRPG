# Conceal an Object

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** 2<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained
You hide a small object on your person (such as a weapon with the [light](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Weapons/Glossary/#light) property). You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture.

When you try to sneak a concealed object past someone who might notice it, when a creature is specifically you for an item, or when a creature is using the [seek](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Seek/) action in an area, the GM rolls a [perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/) check for the obersever and compares it to your [stealth](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Stealth/) skill. If the creature succeeds, they find the object. If the creatures fails the check, the object remains undetected.
