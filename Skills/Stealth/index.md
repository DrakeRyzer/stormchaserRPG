# Stealth
Make a stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

## Hiding
The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a stealth check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the perception check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

**Passive Perception.** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your stealth check with that creature's passive perception score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has +1d, add 4. For -1d, subtract 4.

For example, if a character has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in perception (+1d), they have a passive perception of 16.

**What Can You See?** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in [Vision and Light](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/VisionandLight/).

## Hiding While Invisible
Whilst invisible, you may forgo your movement to gain an additional +1d on stealth checks to hide. If you also use your action to keep still and hold your breath, you gain +1d a third time. You must keep spending your action to maintain this increase.

## Distraction
While you are hidden from a creature, you can throw a pebble or make a sound meant to confuse and distract them. You must be aware of the creature's approximate location or direction of movement. Make a sleight of hand or performance check depending on your distraction method, vs the creature's passive insight or passive investigation (the target chooses).

If you succeed, the creature is distracted until the end of its next turn. Distracted creatures have disadvantage on perception checks and cannot use their passive perception.

If you fail, you must make a new stealth check with -1d vs the target's passive perception.

## Subskills

### Camouflage
Camouflage is a great tool for staking out targets or keeping your party hidden while resting.

### Tailing
Wanting to move and not be noticed isn't just for Rogues. Keepers of Law or Bounty Hunters can find it useful for tracking targets. Either way, if you plan to move and be hidden Tailing is a useful skill to know.
