# Distraction

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** 2<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
While you are hidden from a creature, you can throw a pebble or make a sound meant to confuse and distract them. You must be aware of the creature's approximate location or direction of movement. Make a sleight of hand or performance check depending on your distraction method, vs the creature's passive insight or passive investigation (the target chooses).

If you succeed, the creature is distracted until the end of its next turn. Distracted creatures have disadvantage on perception checks and cannot use their passive perception.

If you fail, you must make a new stealth check with -1d vs the target's passive perception.
