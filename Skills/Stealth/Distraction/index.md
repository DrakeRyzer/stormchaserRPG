# Distraction

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** 2<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
While you are hidden from a creature, you can throw a pebble or make a sound meant to confuse and distract them. You must be aware of the creature's approximate location or direction of movement. Make a sleight of hand or performance check, depending on your distraction method, vs the creature's passive insight.

**Success:** The creature is distracted until the end of its next turn. Distracted creatures have -1d on perception checks and cannot use their passive perception.

**Failure:** You must make a new stealth check with -1d vs the target's passive perception.
