# Hide
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following [the rules for hiding](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/UsingAbilityScores/UsingEachAbility/Dexterity/#hiding). If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in [Unseen Attackers and Targets](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/MakinganAttack/UnseenAttackersandTargets/).

The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a stealth check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the perception check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

Passive Perception. When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your stealth check with that creature's passive perception score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has +1d, add 4. For -1d, subtract 4.

For example, if a character has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in perception (+1d), they have a passive perception of 16.

What Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in Vision and Light.
