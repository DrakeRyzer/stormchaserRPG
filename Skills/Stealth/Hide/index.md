# Hide
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following [the rules for hiding](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/UsingAbilityScores/UsingEachAbility/Dexterity/#hiding). If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in [Unseen Attackers and Targets](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/MakinganAttack/UnseenAttackersandTargets/).
