# Tie a Knot

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained
The rules are purposely open-ended concerning mundane tasks like tying knots, but sometimes knowing how well a knot was fashioned is important in a dramatic scene when someone is trying to untie a knot or slip out of one.

The creature who ties the knot makes an Intelligence-based Sleight of Hand check when doing so. The total of the check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie the knot with an Intelligence-based Sleight of Hand check or to slip out of it with a Dexterity-based [Athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check.

This rule intentionally links Sleight of Hand with Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This is an example of how to apply the rule for skills with different abilities.
