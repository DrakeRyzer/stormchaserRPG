# Disable a Device

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Required Proficiency:** Trained<br><br>**Actions:** 2<br>**Requirements:** Some devices may require [Thieves' Tools](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/ThievesTools/) to disable
This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. Sometimes, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. Thieves' tools are helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in Sleight of Hand to disable it.

Your Sleight of Hand check result determines how much progress you make.

**Critical Success:** You disable the device, or you achieve two successes towards disabling a complex device. You leave no trace of your tampering and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.

**Success:** You disable the device, or you achieve one success towards disabling a complex device.

**Critical Failure:** You trigger the device.
