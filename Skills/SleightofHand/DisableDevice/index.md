# Disable Device
## Proficiency: Trained<br>Requirement: Some devices may require Thieves Tools to disable
This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. Sometimes, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. Thievesâ€™ tools are helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in sleight of hand to disable it.

Your sleight of hand check result determines how much progress you make.

Critical Success You disable the device, or you achieve two successes toward disabling a complex device. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed. Success You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a complex device. Critical Failure You trigger the device.
