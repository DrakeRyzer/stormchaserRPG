# Pick a Lock

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Manipulate*<br>**Actions:** 2<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Requirements:** You're holding or wearing [Thieves' Tools](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/ThievesTools/)
Opening a lock without a key is very similar to Disabling a Device, but the DC of the check is determined by the complexity and construction of the lock that you are attempting to pick (locks and their DCs are found [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Gear/Descriptions/#lock)). Locks of higher qualities might require multiple successes to unlock, since otherwise even an unskilled burglar could easily crack the lock by attempting the check until they rolled a natural 20. If you lack the proper tools, the GM might let you used improvised picks, which are treated as shoddy tools, depending on the specifics of the lock.

**Critical Success:** You unlock the lock, or you achieve two successes toward opening a complex lock. You leave no trace of your tampering.

**Success:** You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward opening a complex lock.

**Critical Failure:** You break your tools. Fixing them requires using [Smith's Tools](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/ArtisansTools/#smiths-tools) to Repair them, or else swapping in replacement picks (costing 3 sp, or 3 gp for infiltrator thievesâ€™ tools).
