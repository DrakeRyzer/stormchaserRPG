# Sleight of Hand
Sleight of hand is a **Dexterity**-based skill for whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person. The GM might also call for a sleight of hand check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

## Untrained Actions
The following actions are ones which can be performed by anyone, regardless of skill. The exact level of success will be greater when done by someone of higher skill, but anyone can be reasonably expected to perform these tasks.

### Palm an Object
Palming a small, unattended object without being noticed requires you to roll a single sleight of hand check against the Perception (Passive or Active) of all creatures who are currently observing you. You take the object whether or not you successfully conceal that you did so. You can typically only Palm Objects weighing 1 pount or less, though the GM might determine otherwise depending on the situation.

Success: The creature does not notice you Palming the Object.
Failure: The creature notices you Palming the Object, and the GM determines the creature’s response.

### Steal
You try to take a small object from another creature without being noticed. Typically, you can Steal only an object weighing 1 pound or less, and you automatically fail if the creature who has the object is in combat or on guard.

Attempt a sleight of hand check to determine if you successfully Steal the object. The DC to Steal is based on the Perception of the target that possesses the object. This assumes the object is worn but not closely guarded (like a loosely carried pouch filled with coins, or an object within such a pouch). If the object is in a pocket or similarly protected, you take -1d to your sleight of hand check. The GM might increase the DC of your check if the nature of the object makes it harder to steal (such as a very small item in a large pack, or a sheet of parchment mixed in with other documents).

You might also need to compare your sleight of hand check result against the Perception of observers other than the person wearing the object. The GM may decrease the action DC of these observers if they’re distracted.

Success: You steal the item without the bearer noticing, or an observer doesn’t see you take or attempt to take the item.
Failure: The item’s bearer notices your attempt before you can take the object, or an observer sees you take or attempt to take the item. The GM determines the response of any creature that notices your theft.

### Tying Knots
The rules are purposely open-ended concerning mundane tasks like tying knots, but sometimes knowing how well a knot was fashioned is important in a dramatic scene when someone is trying to untie a knot or slip out of one.

The creature who ties the knot makes an Intelligence-based sleight of hand check when doing so. The total of the check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie the knot with an Intelligence-based sleight of hand check or to slip out of it with a Dexterity-based athletics check.

This rule intentionally links Sleight of Hand with Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This is an example of how to apply the rule for skills with different abilities.

## Trained Actions
The following tasks are those that require a measure of skill to perform. While an untrained person can attempt the action, the chances of success are not readily in their favor. 

## Disable a Device
#### **Requirement:** Some devices may require Thieves Tools to disable
This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. Sometimes, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. Thieves’ tools are helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in sleight of hand to disable it.

Your sleight of hand check result determines how much progress you make.

Critical Success You disable the device, or you achieve two successes toward disabling a complex device. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.
Success You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a complex device.
Critical Failure You trigger the device.

## Pick a Lock
#### **Requirement:** Thieves Tools
Opening a lock without a key is very similar to Disabling a Device, but the DC of the check is determined by the complexity and construction of the lock you are attempting to pick (locks and their DCs are found in their description). Locks of higher qualities might require multiple successes to unlock, since otherwise even an unskilled burglar could easily crack the lock by attempting the check until they rolled a natural 20. If you lack the proper tools, the GM might let you used improvised picks, which are treated as shoddy tools, depending on the specifics of the lock.

Critical Success You unlock the lock, or you achieve two successes toward opening a complex lock. You leave no trace of your tampering.
Success You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward opening a complex lock.
Critical Failure You break your tools. Fixing them requires time and materials to repair them, or you can use another set of tools, if available.
## Subskills

### Concealment
While pickpocketing is great for liberating things from less observant targets, Concealment is great for making sure perceptive individuals aren't going to notice objects you've hidden. The GM should set the DC based on the size of the object and how difficult it would be to hide.

### Juggling
Whether catching something to prevent it from falling or entertaining a crowd, it's not an uncommon skill for those with quick reflexes to pick up. 

### Pickpocketing
Planting evidence or filling your pockets with the possessions of others, Pickpocketing is a staple in every major city.
