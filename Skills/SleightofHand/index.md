# Sleight of Hand
Sleight of hand is a **Dexterity**-based skill for whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person. The GM might also call for a sleight of hand check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

### Concealment
While pickpocketing is great for liberating things from less observant targets, Concealment is great for making sure perceptive individuals aren't going to notice objects you've hidden. The GM should set the DC based on the size of the object and how difficult it would be to hide.

### Juggling
Whether catching something to prevent it from falling or entertaining a crowd, it's not an uncommon skill for those with quick reflexes to pick up. 

### Pickpocketing
Planting evidence or filling your pockets with the possessions of others, Pickpocketing is a staple in every major city.
