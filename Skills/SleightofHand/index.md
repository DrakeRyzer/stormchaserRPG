# Sleight of Hand
Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a sleight of hand check. The GM might also call for a sleight of hand check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

## Tying Knots
The rules are purposely open-ended concerning mundane tasks like tying knots, but sometimes knowing how well a knot was fashioned is important in a dramatic scene when someone is trying to untie a knot or slip out of one.

The creature who ties the knot makes an Intelligence-based sleight of hand check when doing so. The total of the check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie the knot with an Intelligence-based sleight of hand check or to slip out of it with a Dexterity-based athletics check.

This rule intentionally links Sleight of Hand with Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This is an example of how to apply the rule for skills with different abilities.

## Subskills

### Concealment
While pickpocketing is great for liberating things from less observant targets, Concealment is great for making sure perceptive individuals aren't going to notice objects you've hidden. The GM should set the DC based on the size of the object and how difficult it would be to hide.

### Juggling
Whether catching something to prevent it from falling or entertaining a crowd, it's not an uncommon skill for those with quick reflexes to pick up. 

### Pickpocketing
Planting evidence or filling your pockets with the possessions of others, Pickpocketing is a staple in every major city.
