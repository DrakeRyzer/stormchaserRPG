# Persuasion
Persuasion is a **Charisma**-based skill for when you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

## Subskills

### Bargaining

Honest merchants prefer a fair bargain versus a cunning tongue. The best deals are the ones which benefit everyone. 

### Debate
You might be right, and they might be wrong, but if you don't understand the best way to express that then you'll truly have your work cut out for you.

### Etiquette 
While your usual skills of persuasion will work with the commoners, nobles and gentry will require a much more refined touch. That's when it's time to break out your Etiquette skills to impress.

### Leadership
Anyone can send a troupe of soldiers into battle. A leader will be there to inspire them to stay on the battlefield when the going gets tough, or to ignore their exhaustion when they're tired. The GM should set the DC based on how loyal that group is to the leader as well as what the leader is asking of that group.

### Provocation
Your cunning words cut deeper than your sword, and it is a fair reason to make anyone react angrily, violently, or emotionally against their best interests.

### Seduction
If you've got it, flaunt it. Of course there's no promise that you are what your target is looking for, but nothing ventured, nothing gained.
