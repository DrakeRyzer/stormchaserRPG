# Swimming

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Move*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
You propel yourself through water. In most calm water, you succeed at the action without needing to attempt a check. If you must breathe air and you’re submerged in water, you must hold your breath each round. If you fail to hold your breath, you begin to [suffocate](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/Suffocating/). Other rules for movement while swimming are detailed in [Special Types of Movement](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Movement/SpecialTypesofMovement/#climbing-swimming-and-crawling). 

If the water is turbulent, or another factor affects your ability to swim such as combat or a heavy burden, you will need to attempt an [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check to maintain your normal control and swimming speed. Failing this check may result in loss of control and/or forced movement. If you end your turn in water and haven’t succeeded at a Swim action that turn, you sink 10 feet or get moved by the current, as determined by the GM. However, if your last action on your turn was to enter the water, you don’t sink or move with the current that turn.

If you are fighting while swimming, there are many additional factors and dangers that may be considered aside from the ability to swim. These are further detailed [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Special/Aquatic/).
