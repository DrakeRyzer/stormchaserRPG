# Reducing Damage from Falling

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Move*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Requirements:** None
When you fall, a DC 15 athletics check allows you to ignore the first 10 feet fallen, although you still end up prone if you take damage from a fall.

You can also negate damage when you fall off a mount. If you fail the Athletics check, you take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and are prone.
