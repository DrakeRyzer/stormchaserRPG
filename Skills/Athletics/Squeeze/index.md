# Squeeze

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Exploration, Move*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Requirements:** None
You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small spaces; many tight spaces are difficult terrain that you can move through more quickly and without a check.

**Critical Success:** You squeeze through the tight space in 1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing.

**Success:** You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.

**Critical Failure:** You become stuck in the tight space. While youâ€™re stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check at the same DC. Any result on that check other than a critical failure causes you to become unstuck.
