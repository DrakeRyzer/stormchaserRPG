# Maneuver in Flight

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Move*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Requirements:** None
You try a difficult maneuver while flying. Attempt an Athletics check. The GM determines what maneuvers are possible, but they rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.

**Success:** You succeed at the maneuver.<br>
:**Failure:** Your maneuver fails. The GM chooses if you simply canâ€™t move or if some other detrimental effect happens. The outcome should be appropriate for the maneuver you attempted (for instance, being blown off course if you were trying to fly against a strong wind).<br>
**Critical Failure:** As failure, but the consequence is more dire.
