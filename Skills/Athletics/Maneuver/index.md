# Maneuver in Flight

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Move*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Requirements:** None
You try a difficult maneuver while flying. Attempt an [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check. The GM determines what maneuvers are possible, but they rarely allow you to move farther than your fly speed.

**Success:** You succeed at the maneuver.

**Failure:** Your maneuver fails. The GM chooses if you simply canâ€™t move, or if some other detrimental effect happens. The outcome should be appropriate for the maneuver that you attempted (for instance, being blown off course if you were trying to fly against a strong wind).

**Critical Failure:** As failure, but the consequence is more dire.
