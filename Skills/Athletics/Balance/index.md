# Balance

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Move*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
You can use [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) to cross narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling. You are [flat-footed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Flatfooted/) while on a narrow surface or uneven ground. If you take damage while using balancing, you must make another check at the same DC to avoid falling or being knocked prone.

Use the following table to determine the base DC, which is modified by the second table below. An [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check is only required to move across these surfaces if the final DC is 10 or higher.

| Surface Width | Base Athletics DC |
|:-------------:|:------------------:|
| >3 feet wide | 0 |
| 1–3 feet wide | 5 |
| 7–11 inches wide | 10 |
| 2–6 inches wide | 15 |
| &#60;2 inches wide | 20 |

| Athletics Modifiers | DC Modifier |
|:--------------------:|:-----------:|
| Lightly Obstructed (gravel, sand) | +2 |
| Severely Obstructed (cavern, rubble) | +5 |
| Slightly Slippery (wet) | +2 |
| Severely Slippery (icy) | +5 |
| Slightly Sloped (&#60;45°) | +2 |
| Severely Sloped (>45°) | +5 |
| Slightly Unsteady (boat in rough water) | +2 |
| Mildly Unsteady (boat in a storm) | +5 |
| Severely Unsteady (earthquake) | +10 |

**Critical Success:** You move up to your Speed.

**Success:** You move up to your speed, treating it as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement).

**Failure:** You must remain stationary to keep your balance (wasting the action) or you fall. If you fall, your turn ends.

**Critical Failure:** You fall and your turn ends.
