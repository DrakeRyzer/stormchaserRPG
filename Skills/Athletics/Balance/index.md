# Crossing Narrow Surfaces/Uneven Ground

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Move*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
You can use athletics to cross narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling. A successful check allows you to move at half speed across such surfaces. Use the following table to determine the base DC, which is modified by the second table below. A Dexterity (Athletics) check is only required to move across these surfaces if the final DC is 10 or higher.

While you are using athletics in this way, melee and ranged attacks have advantage to hit you. If you take damage while using athletics, you must make another check at the same DC to avoid falling or being knocked prone.

| >3 feet wide | 0 |
| 1–3 feet wide | 5 |
| 7–11 inches wide | 10 |
| 2–6 inches wide | 15 |
| &#60;2 inches wide | 20 |
