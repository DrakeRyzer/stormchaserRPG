# Climb

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Move*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
You move up, down, or across an incline. Unless it’s particularly easy, you must attempt an [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check. The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and environmental circumstances. You’re [flat-footed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Flatfooted/) unless you have a climb speed, as detailed in [Special Types of Movement](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Movement/SpecialTypesofMovement/#climbing-swimming-and-crawling). If you have a climb speed, you also receive +1d to your [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) checks due to your adapted comfort to the task.
