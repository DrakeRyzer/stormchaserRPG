<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Move*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
You move up, down, or across an incline. Unless it’s particularly easy, you must attempt an Athletics check. The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and environmental circumstances. You’re flat-footed unless you have a climb Speed, as detailed in [Special Types of Movement](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Movement/SpecialTypesofMovement/#climbing-swimming-and-crawling). If you have a climb speed, you also receive +1d to your Athletics checks due to your adapted comfort to the task.

| Surface Condition | Base Athletics DC |
|:-------------:|:------------------:|
| Steep incline | 10 |
| Limited grip surfaces | 15 |
| Sheer surface | 20 |

**Critical Success:** You climb successfully and add 5 to your climbing speed
**Success:** You climb successfully at normal movement speed
**Critical Failure:** You fall. If you began the climb on stable ground, you fall and land prone.
