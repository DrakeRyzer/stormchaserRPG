# Force Open

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Attack*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate. Attempts made without the use of a tool receive a -1d penalty. If a tool is used that can be leveraged with two hands, the Athletics check receives +1d. The GM determines the DC of the check based on the structure of the object and any additional mechanisms holding it in place (latch, blockade, magic wards, etc.).

**Critical Success:** You open the door, window, container, or gate and can avoid damaging it in the process.
**Success:** You break the door, window, container, or gate open, it becomes [broken](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Broken/). If itâ€™s especially sturdy, the GM might have it take damage but not be broken.
**Critical Failure:** Your attempt jams the door, window, container, or gate shut, imposing a -1d penalty on future attempts to Force it Open.
