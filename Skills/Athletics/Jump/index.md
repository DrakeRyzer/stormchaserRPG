# Jump

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Move*<br>**Actions:** 2<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
You [stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/), then make a [leap](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Leap/) and attempt an [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check to increase how far you jump.

## Long Jump
When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet equal to the result of your [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check. You can’t [leap](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Leap/) farther than your speed.

If you didn’t [stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/) at least 10 feet, or if you attempt to jump in a different direction than your [stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/), you automatically fail your check. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the situation, as determined by the GM.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity-based [athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

## High Jump
You leap into the air a number of feet equal to the result of your athletics check divided by three. If you didn’t [stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/) at least 10 feet, you automatically fail your check. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the situation, as determined by the GM.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

**Success:** Increase the maximum distance that you [leap](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Leap/) to the desired distance.

**Failure:** You [leap](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Leap/) normally.

**Critical Failure:** You [leap](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Leap/) normally, but then fall and land prone.
