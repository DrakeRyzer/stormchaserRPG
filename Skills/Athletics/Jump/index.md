# Jumping

#### *Move*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

### Long Jump
When you make a long jump, make an athletics check. You cover a number of feet equal to the result of your athletics check. If you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump, you cover *at least* a number of feet up to your Strength score. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap *at least* up to half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 athletics check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity-based athletics check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

### High Jump
When you make a high jump, make an athletics check. You leap into the air a number of feet equal to the result of your athletics check divided by three. If you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump, you leap into the air *at least* a number of feet equal up to 3 + your Strength modifier. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump *at least* up to half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1Â½ times your height.
