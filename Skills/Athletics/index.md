# Athletics

## Strength
Athletics checks based on Strength covers difficult situations that you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:
* You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
* You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt mid-jump.
* You struggle to swim or slay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed.
* Another creature tries to push or pull you underwater, or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

### Jumping
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

#### Long Jump
When you make a long jump, make an athletics check. You cover a number of feet equal to the result of your athletics check. If you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump, you cover *at least* a number of feet up to your Strength score. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap *at least* up to half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 athletics check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity-based athletics check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

#### High Jump
When you make a high jump, make an athletics check. You leap into the air a number of feet equal to the result of your athletics check divided by three. If you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump, you leap into the air *at least* a number of feet equal up to 3 + your Strength modifier. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump *at least* up to half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

### Subskills

#### Climbing
Scaling cliffsides or reaching rooftops, few players have lasting careers without the use of climbing out of trouble.

#### Jumping
Jumping allows players to leap in great bounds horizontally, or try to attain great heights vertically.

#### Mining
Extracting minerals and metals from the ground is a staple in worlds where iron and steel see kingdoms rise and fall. This is a new use of the Athletics skill. GMs should set DCs based on how long or difficult it would take to extract valuables. Failure results in half yields.

#### Swimming
Crossing rapid streams, delving into the lair of a black dragon, or communing with mermaids, few are the players who stay dry forever.

## Dexterity
Athletics check based on dexterity cover attempts to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity-based athletics check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

### Cross Narrow Surfaces/Uneven Ground
You can use athletics to cross narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling. A successful check allows you to move at half speed across such surfaces. Use the following table to determine the base DC, which is modified by the second table below. A Dexterity (Athletics) check is only required to move across these surfaces if the final DC is 10 or higher.

While you are using athletics in this way, melee and ranged attacks have advantage to hit you. If you take damage while using athletics, you must make another check at the same DC to avoid falling or being knocked prone.

### Falling
When you fall, a DC 15 athletics check allows you to ignore the first 10 feet fallen, although you still end up prone if you take damage from a fall.

You can also negate damage when you fall off a mount. If you fail the Athletics check, you take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and are prone.

| Surface Width | Base Athletics DC |
|:-------------:|:------------------:|
| >3 feet wide | 0 |
| 1–3 feet wide | 5 |
| 7–11 inches wide | 10 |
| 2–6 inches wide | 15 |
| &#60;2 inches wide | 20 |

| Athletics Modifiers | DC Modifier |
|:--------------------:|:-----------:|
| Lightly Obstructed (gravel, sand) | +2 |
| Severely Obstructed (cavern, rubble) | +5 |
| Slightly Slippery (wet) | +2 |
| Severely Slippery (icy) | +5 |
| Slightly Sloped (&#60;45°) | +2 |
| Severely Sloped (>45°) | +5 |
| Slightly Unsteady (boat in rough water) | +2 |
| Mildly Unsteady (boat in a storm) | +5 |
| Severely Unsteady (earthquake) | +10 |
| Move at full speed | +5 |

### Subskills

#### Aerobatics
Tumbling and swimming are great for players darting around foes on the ground and underwater, but Aerobatics helps airborne players do the same. GMs should set DCs similar to those skills for flying creatures.

#### Balance
Crossing narrow bridges, riding choppy seas, or running across ice, most players actively avoid trying to fall prone.

#### Diving
Sometimes a belly flop is fine, but most players want to avoid taking damage when falling into water. Slipping unnoticed into water to evade a dock guard might come in handy for port rogues.

#### Escapology
Between spider webs and bounty hunter manacles, a quick Escape is sometimes the better part of valor.

#### Tumbling
Avoiding damage from a big fall or sliding through an opponents legs, mobile characters often need to tumble.

## Constitution
Athletics checks based on Constitution are made when your character needs to push their bodies beyond normal limits. Holding your breath, marching for days, going without sleep or food, and resisting the effects of alcohol are all times when one would roll an athletics check.

### Subskills

#### Distance Running
Sprinting short distances is fine, but sometimes players need to cover vast distances without rest. Distance Running allows you to maintain your pace. GMs should use Distance Running to allow players to cover greater distances overland than usual, with failure resulting in exhaustion.

#### Environmental Adaptation
Over time, your body and mind have adapted to an environment. When using your Athletics skill to resist the naturally occurring effects of that terrain, you can use adaptation instead. For example, in a desert, you could use it to resist lack of water or overwhelming heat.

When picking this subskill, select one type of terrain or environment. You can take this expertise multiple times, selecting one new environment each time. The terrain available to Rangers via the Natural Explorer trait (*Player's Handbook*, pg. 91) are the options you can choose from, each time you take Environmental Adaptation expertise. 
* Arctic
* Coast
* Desert
* Forest
* Grassland
* Mountain
* Nautical
* Swamp
* Underdark
* Nautical

#### Pain Tolerance
Information is power, and to that end torturers consider information extraction an art. Pain Tolerance allows you to resist their craft. The GM should use Athletics or Pain Tolerance as the skill to resist Torture.
