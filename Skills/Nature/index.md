# Nature
Nature is an **Intelligence**-based skill that measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

## Subskills

### Beast Lore
Lions, Tigers and Bears. And Giant Rats. And Dinosaurs. Prepared players are ready for all of these horrors nature decided to throw at them.

### Botany
If it's not walking, talking and thinking but it's still a plant, those trained in botany know all about it. Farmers, cooks, rangers, and scholars tend to fill out their ranks.

### Cartography
There's a big difference between being able to read the lay of the land in person, and reading a map. Knowing how to create and read maps is especially important for adventurers wanting to explore new lands.

### Fey Lore
The Seelie and Unseelie courts are something no rational character will want to delve into, but rarely do you interact with these strange beings of your own volition.

### Geography
Knowing how and why mountains form, what rocks lay under the ocean and which side of trees moss tends to are all skills useful to those who trek through the wilds. You can read the lay of the land faster than any map.

### Geology
No dwarf worth their salt would be caught dead not knowing the differences between rock types. If you plan on delving through caves or even the Underdark, it's advised you listen to their knowledge.

### Ooze Lore
One would think that Oozes don't have much lore behind them but the Oozeologists of the worlds disagree. These creatures have a tendency to inhabit exactly the places which players need to go.

### Plant Lore
While farmers grow wheat and rotting wood grows new mushrooms, there are more mobile threats to the world. 

### Poison
Is a substance safe to touch? To breathe? To apply to your weapon? Not all poisons are created equal and their dangerous nature means understanding them makes you much safer.
