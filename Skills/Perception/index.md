# Perception
Perception is a **Wisdom**-based skill that lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

## Passive Perception
Your innate ability to automatically notice important things in your surroundings without a skill roll can act as a minimum result to your Active Perception rolls. For that to happen, you must declare that you are "Alert for...", followed by descriptor of what you are actively looking for: enemies, secret doors, peculiar behaviour in a crowd, or others things. While you are Alert, if the GM requests a Perception skill check he may allow you to take a minimum value of 10 if the die roll is lower. The GM must also reveal information below the Perception DC if it matches the Alert descriptor.

In order to remain Alert, you must not engage in activities that require concentration such as talking (except simple commands), working, fighting, casting or maintaining a spell. Some GMs may want to enforce a rule that distracted players engaged in small talk during play lose the Alert status, or even get disadvantage on their roll. 

Having special senses (such as heatsense or tremorsight) that complement Perception add +2 to Passive Perception for each applicable sense. This is separate from advantage (+4) or disadvantage (-4) modifiers to Passive Perception.

## Enemy Alertness
Enemy creatures have various levels of Alertness that affect their Passive Perception. High Alert creatures know they are in a dangerous situation and enemies could be nearby. Low Alert creatures guard their close vicinity but do not expect an immediate threat. Unaware creatures consider themselves completely safe in their environment. 

 When enemy creatures engage in activities that requires concentration such as talking, eating, urinating, etc. they temporarily lower their Alertness level to Unaware. 

| State | Passive Perception |
|:------|:-------------------|
| High Alert | 10 + Wisdom modifier +1d, even if they are not proficient in perception |
| Low Alert | 10 + Wisdom modifier +1d if they are proficient in perception |
| Unaware | 10 + Wisdom modifier. Modifier value can't be higher than 0, unless they are proficient in perception |

> ## Finding A Hidden Object
> When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks you to make a perception check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.
> 
> In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the GM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the GM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your perception check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.

## Subskills

### Eavesdropping
Listening through a door, from a distance, or around a corner is not an easy task. Another one of those skills that urban adventurers find useful.

### Guarding
You have an ever-watchful eye that can spot movement or any other irregularities around you. You keep a perfect watch, able to tell friend from foe and patiently guard your surroundings. 

### Tasting
Wow, you can really taste the poison! Every lord, king, or emperor will be glad they have royal tasters specially trained in picking out the dangers lurking within their food.
