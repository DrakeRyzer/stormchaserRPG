# Skills
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Athletics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. See [each ability's description](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/UsingAbilityScores/UsingEachAbility/) for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.
* **Strength**: Athletics
* **Dexterity**: Athletics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth
* **Constitution**: Athletics
* **Intelligence**: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Religion
* **Wisdom**: Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival
* **Charisma**: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill. For example, "make a Wisdom (Perception) check". At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means that an individual can make ability checks that involve that skill with advantage. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Game Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, then the character makes the Strength check with advantage. If the character lacks that proficiency, then they just make a Strength check.

## Skills with Different Abilities
Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. For example, proficiency in Athletics usually applies to Strength checks. However, in some situations your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if a half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, the GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma. So, if the barbarian is proficient in intimidation, then they may apply a proficiency die to the Strength check, just as one would normally do for a Charisma (Intimidation) check.
