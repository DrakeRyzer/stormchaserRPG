# Demoralise

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Auditory, Concentrate, Emotion, Fear, Mental*<br>**Actions:** 1
With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting putdown, you can shake an enemy's resolve. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you're aware of. Make an Intimidation check vs the target's Charisma defense. If the target does not understand the language that you're speaking, or you're not speaking a language, then you suffer -1d to your roll. Regardless of the result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralise it for 10 minutes.

**Critical Success:** The target becomes [Shaken](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Shaken/) for 1 minute.
**Success:** The target becomes [Shaken](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Shaken/) for 1 round.
