# Intimidation
Intimidation is a **Charisma**-based skill for when you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

## Subskills

### Savagery
Talking to barbarians, tribal creatures, and other so-called 'uncivilized' societies requires a different set of skills from playing around in a court. The Savagery skill is used in the same way that Etiquette is used in civilized places or Zeal in locations of faith.

### Interrogation
Extracting information from a source, sometimes by force. The GM should use a character's passive Constitution (Athletics (Pain Tolerance)) score to set the DC for using this skill.
