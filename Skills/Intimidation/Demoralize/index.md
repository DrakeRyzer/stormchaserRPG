With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting putdown, you can shake an enemy's resolve. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you're aware of. Attempt an Intimidation check against that target's CHA or WIS defense. If the target does not understand the language you are speaking, or you're not speaking a language, you receive a -1d penalty to your roll. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it for 10 minutes.

**Critical Success:** The target becomes [Shaken](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Shaken/) for 1 minute.
**Success:** The target becomes [Shaken](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Shaken/) for 1 round.
