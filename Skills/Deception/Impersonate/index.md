# Impersonate

#### *Concentrate, Exploration, Manipulate, Secret*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** [Disguise Kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/Disguise/)
You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a [disguise kit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/Disguise/), but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.

In most cases, creatures only have a chance to detect your deception if they use the [seek](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Seek/) action vs your passive [deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/). If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls this secretly instead. If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a bonus or penalty based on how well they know the person that you’re imitating, or the GM might roll a secret [perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/) check even if you aren’t directly interacting with others.

**Success:** You trick the creature into thinking that you’re the person you’re disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check if your behaviour changes.

**Failure:** The creature can tell that you’re not who you claim to be.

**Critical Failure:** The creature can tell that you’re not who you claim to be and it recognises you, if it would know you without a disguise.
