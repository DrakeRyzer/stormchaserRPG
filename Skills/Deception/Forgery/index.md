# Create a Forgery

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Downtime, Secret*<br>**Actions:** Special<br>**Required Proficiency:** Trained<br>**Requirements:** See below
You create a forged document, usually over the course of a day or a week. You must have the proper writing material to create a forgery. When you create a forgery, make a [deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) check. If you have expert proficiency with the tool used to create the forgery, you check receives +1d. If you have master proficiency, this additional bonus increases to +2d. Those who carefully examine the document can attempt an Insight check against the result of your [deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) check to reveal the fake.

If the document’s handwriting doesn’t need to be specific to a person and you have seen a similar document before, you gain +1d to your roll. To forge a specific person’s handwriting, you need a sample of that person’s handwriting and suffer a penalty of -1d to your roll.

**Success:** The observer does not detect the forgery.

**Failure:** The observer knows your document is a forgery.
