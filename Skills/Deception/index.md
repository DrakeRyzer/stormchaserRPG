# Deception
Deception is a **Charisma**-based skill that determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

## Subskills

### Acting
From impressing audiences in amphitheaters of large cites to tricking mob bosses in sewer lairs, the skill of Acting can be plied widely across the land.

### Boasting
Drunks from taverns across the world, trained or otherwise, flood the ears of passers by with the Boasting skill. Of course, every single boasted tale is absolutely factual as well! 

### Disguise
This is the ability to apply pigments, makeup, and prosthetics to literally make someone look unlike themselves. The GM should set the DC according to how difficult it would be to make the target look like something else.

### Fast-talk
Your lips are just as quick as your wits, and combining both throws people off of the intent of your words and directly where you want them (provided they don't notice your duplicity).

### Mimicry
Calling out to a goblin tribe, mimicking their war boss, and having them let prisoners loose is a great test of your Mimicry skill. Of course, sounding like someone isn't enough to convince people you are them but it's a start.
