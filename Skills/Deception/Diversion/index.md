# Create a Diversion

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Mental*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and linguistic traits.

Mkae a Deception check against the Perception of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed against a target, future attempts to Create a Diversion receive -1d against for 1 minute.

**Success:** You become hidden to each creature whose Perception is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to Sneak away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the Hide or the Move Silently action of the Stealth skill. If you Strike a creature, the creature remains flat-footed against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.
**Failure:** You donâ€™t divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.
