# Create a Diversion

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Mental*<br>**Actions:** 1<br>**Required Proficiency:** Untrained<br>**Requirements:** None
With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and linguistic traits.

Mkae a [deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) check vs the passive [perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/) of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed against a target, future attempts to divert the same targets suffer -1d for 1 minute.

**Success:** You become hidden to each creature whose passive [perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/) is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to Sneak away.) This lasts until the end of your turn, or until you do anything except [step](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Step/) or use the [hide](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Stealth/Hide/) or the [move silently](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Stealth/Move/) action of the [stealth](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Stealth/) skill. If you [strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) a creature, the creature remains flat-footed against that attack and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.

**Failure:** You donâ€™t divert the attention of any creatures whose passive [perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/) exceeds your result and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.
