# Long Rest
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity (at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity) the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost stamina. Finishing a long rest also reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period and a character must have at least 1 stamina at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
