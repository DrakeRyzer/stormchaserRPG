# Breather
A breather is a brief period of rest, at least 5 minutes long, during which a character catches their breath.

A character can spend one or more Stamina Dice at the end of a breather, up to half of the character's maximum number of Stamina Dice (minimum of 1), which is equal to the character's total number of talents. For each Stamina Die spent in this way, the character can choose to regain stamina or spell points.

To recover stamina, the player rolls the Stamina Die and adds the characterâ€™s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains stamina equal to the total (minimum of 0).

To recover spell points, the player also rolls their Stamina Die. The character regains spell points equal to the total.

The player can decide to spend an additional Stamina Dice after each roll. A character regains some spent Stamina Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.
