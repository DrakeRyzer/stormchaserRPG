# Breather
A breather is a brief period of rest, at least 5 minutes long, during which a character catches their breath.

A character can spend one or more Hit Die at the end of a breather, up to half of the character's maximum number of Hit Dice (minimum of 1), which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the character can choose to regain hit points or spell points.

To recover hit points, the player rolls the Hit Die and adds the characterâ€™s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0).

To recover spell points, the player rolls their spell point die (see chapter 10). The character regains spell points equal to the total.

The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.
