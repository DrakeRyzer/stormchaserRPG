# Short Rest
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can roll two recovery dice at the end of a short rest. For each recovery die spent in this way, the character can choose to regain stamina or mana.

To recover stamina, the player rolls the recovery die and adds the characterâ€™s Constitution modifier to it. The character recovers stamina equal to the total (minimum of 0).

To recover mana, the player rolls their recovery die. The character recovers mana equal to the total.

At the end of the short rest, if a character has exactly 1 level of Exhaustion, then they may remove that level.
