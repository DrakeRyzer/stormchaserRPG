# Food and Water
Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

## Food
A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

## Water
A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. When travelling, hot weather and deserts also double the water intake to 2 pints per travel leg. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution (Endurance) check or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character has already gone one day without water, the character suffers two levels of exhaustion. If the character has already gone two days without water, the character suffers three levels of exhaustion.

### Desperate Measures
You can quench thirst by eating raw meat or fresh plants. Each 2 pints of fresh blood or 1 pound of fresh plants counts as 1 pint of water.

You can drink dirty water or blood from a carcass, it makes an attack with a +5 bonus vs your Constitution defence. On a hit, you vomit and the next sickness attack vs your Constitution defence has advantage. 

## Other Creature Sizes
The food and water requirements above are for characters. Horses and other creatures require different quantities of food and water per day based on their size. Water needs are doubled if the weather is hot.
