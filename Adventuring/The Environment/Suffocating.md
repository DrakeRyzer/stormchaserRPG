### Suffocating
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). If a creature takes an action, the remaining time that it can hold its breath for is reduced by 1 round.

After this period of time, the creature must make a DC 10 Constitution (Endurance) check in order to continue holding their breath. The check must be repeated each round. When the creature fails one of these Constitution checks, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, each round it has a 35% chance to drop to 0 hit points.
