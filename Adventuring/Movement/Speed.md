# Speed
Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

## Travel Pace
While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the "Activity While Traveling" section later in this chapter for more information).

**Forced March.** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution (Endurance) check at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed check, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.

If the party is moving at a *slow* pace, they gain advantage on the check. A *fast* pace imposes disadvantage.

**Mounts and Vehicles.** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see chapter 5), and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace, Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

### Travel Pace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Distance travelled per...**

| Pace | Minute | Hour | Day | Effect |
|:----:|:------:|:----:|:---:|:------:|
| Fast | 400 Feet | 4 Miles | 32 Miles | Disadvantage<br>on Wisdom<br>(Perception) |
| Medium | 300 Feet | 3 Miles | 24 Miles | — |
| Slow | 200 Feet | 2 Miles | 16 Miles | Able to use stealth |

### The Travel Route
Come up with a travel plan then calculate its distance in miles. Break down the full distance into smaller segments by using checkpoint locations such as towns and hamlets, wayside inns, river banks and other points of interest. Break segments when terrain type changes or roads start or end as such changes affect travel speed.

### The Travelling Day
A typical day of travel consists of roughly 9 to 16 hours of activity, out of which there are 6-10 hours of actual travel. At specific times the party must rest, drink and eat.

###### Daily Travel Routine

| Activity | Time | Cost |
|:--------:|:----:|:----:|
| Wake up around sunrise | — | — |
| Breakfast and breaking up camp | — | 1/2 ration |
| First travel leg | 3-5 hours | 1 pint water |
| Midday break | 1-2 hours | 1/2 ration |
| Second travel leg | 3-5 hours | 1 pint water |
| Rest for the night | 8 hours | — |

#### Daylight by Season
The amount of usable daylight vastly depends on the region and/or season you are traveling in.

| Season | Sunrise | Sunset | Time Traveling |
|:------:|:-------:|:------:|:--------------:|
| Summer | 4 am | 20 pm | 16 hours |
| Spring/Autumn | 6 am | 18 pm | 12 hours |
| Winter | 8 am | 16 pm | 8 hours |

### Determine Terrain Difficulty
For each travel day, the GM determines the terrain type and calculates how much distance will be crossed without any larger disruptions (such as combat or a detour to explore unexpected locations).

Several activities during travel refer to the Navigation DC. This DC is dependent on the terrain you are traversing. The harder the terrain, the slower your group will advance during your travel, up to a point where you must concentrate on actually moving, rather than paying attention to other activities. If difficult terrain slows your pace to 0 miles or less, you can still move but at ½ a mile per hour. 

| Terrain Difficulty | DC | Speed Modifier |
|:-------------------|:--:|:--------------:|
| Barren, wasteland | 10 | -1 mile/hour |
| Clear, farmland | 5 | — |
| Desert, rocky | 10 | -1 mile/hour |
| Desert, sand | 15| -2 miles/hour |
| Forest, medium or heavy | 15 | -2 miles/hour |
| Forest, light | 10 | -1 mile/hour |
| Glacier | 10 | -1 mile/hour |
| Grassland, foothills | 5 | — |
| Scrub, bushland, hills |10| -1 mile/hour |
| Jungle, heavy | 20 | -3 miles/hour |
| Jungle, medium | 15 | -2 miles/hour |
| Marsh, swamp | 20 | -3 miles/hour |
| Moor | 15 | -2 miles/hour |
| Mountain, high | 20 | -3 miles/hour |
| Mountain, low or medium | 15 | -2 miles/hour |
| Tundra | 15 | -2 miles/hour |
| Any terrain, by trail | 5 | — |
| Any terrain, by road | 5 | +2 miles/hour |
| Fog, rain, low visibility | +3 | — |
| Storm, snowfall, dark night | +5 | -1 mile/hour |

### Choose Destination and Speed
Players must choose a heading and a travel pace (fast, normal or slow) and how long they will travel for. The party can follow a natural feature of the land like a coast, river or tree line, or just head off in any of the cardinal directions.

If you travel by horse or carriage and you cross *easy* (DC 5) or *moderate* (DC 10) terrain, refer to the Mounted Travel rules for each mount's speed and distance. If you choose to gallop by horse and you cross *easy* (DC 5) terrain, you can use fast pace and increase distance traveled by 33%. If you cross *difficult* terrain (DC 15 or higher), you can only use slow pace and decrease distance traveled by 33%.

###### Travel Paces and Activities

| Pace | Travel Speed  | Favoured | Associated | Hindered | Forbidden |
|:-----|:--------------|:--------:|:----------:|:--------:|:---------:|
| Fast | 4 mph | ——— | ——— | Keep Watch, Navigate, Scout, Track, Trailblaze | Draw Map, Hunt/Forage, Sneak |
| Normal | 3 mph | ——— | Keep Watch, Navigate, Scout, Track, Trailblaze | Draw Map, Hunt/Forage, Sneak | ——— |
| Slow | 2 mph | Keep Watch, Navigate, Scout, Track, Trailblaze | Draw Map, Hunt/Forage, Sneak | ——— | ——— |

### Choose Travel Activities
In each travel leg, a character may carry out one activity of their choice. Some activities allow several players to work as a group. Your chosen pace of travel affects how easy it is to do things during your daily travel legs. 

**Favoured Activities.** Favored activities may be made with advantage when traveling at this pace.

**Associated Activities.** Associated activities are typical activities for the corresponding pace.

**Hindered Activities.** Hindered activities must be made with disadvantage when traveling at this pace.

**Forbidden Activities.** These activities cannot be taken when traveling at this pace.

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/poison-filled.png"> **Dangerous Activities.** Several activities are noted as *Dangerous*. Performing one of these activities usually means having to separate from the group with a risk of being attacked or trapped without help.

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png"> **Distracting Activities .** Some activities are so demanding that you can't pay much attention to your surroundings. While you perform a *Distracting* activity, you suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/napping-filled.png"> **Exhausting Activities.** Some activities are much more tiresome that simple travel. If you perform two *Exhausting* activities on one day, you suffer one level of exhaustion after finishing the second one, but before looking for and setting up camp.

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/west-direction-filled.png"> **Focused Activities.** Most activities can be performed by several players. However, some activities can only be performed by one or two simultaneously. These Focused activities can only be performed by a maximum of 2 players, and you only use the higher of the two check results to determine their effect. 

Each activity has an associated ability check you will make to determine your success or failure during the travel leg. If a player fails their check, they still suffer the consequences.

#### Draw a Map <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/west-direction-filled.png">
**Skill:** Intelligence (Cartographer's tools)

While your companions keep watch, hunt for food and guide the party, you focus on documenting your journey. Drawing a map won't help you on your journey forward, but might prove useful once you try to find your way back. Good maps are also a highly sought-after commodity.

Make an Intelligence (Cartographer's tools) check against the Navigation DC.

* If your guide succeeded on their navigation check, you gain a +5 bonus to your check.
* If they failed by less than 5, you suffer a -5 penalty.
* If you got lost, your check automatically fails.
* For each travel leg, note if you succeeded or failed your cartography check.

Once you have reached your destination, divide the number of successful cartography checks by the total number of legs travelled, and compare the result on the following table:

| Success per Travel Leg | Result |
|:----------------------:|:-------|
| 0.75 |  Detailed Map    |
| 0.5  |  Simple Map      |
| 0.25 |  Crude Map       |
|  0   |  *Wasted Effort* |

#### Hunt/Forage <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/poison-filled.png">
**Skill:** Wisdom (Survival)

During your travels, you keep an eye out for nearby sources of food and water, such as roots, fruits, small game, and hidden springs. You must pick one: either plants, game or water. 

Make a Wisdom (Survival) check and compare the result with the region's abundance level on the following table to determine the number of fresh rations (for 1 day) you can manage to provide, or gallons of water (8 pints) you gather.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Number of Rations / Gallons**

|Abundance|  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |
|:--------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Plenty  | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20 | 22 | 24 |
| Average | 10 | 13 | 16 | 19 | 22 | 25 | 28 | 31 |
| Scarce  | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 | 28 | 32 | 36 | 40 |
| Barren  | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 50 |

#### Keep Watch
**Skill:** Wisdom (Perception)

You keep your eyes peeled and your ears open for any sign of approaching danger, as well as signs of close by pursuers.

Make a Wisdom (Perception) check. If you roll 7 or less, you take 8 as your result. The GM determines the DC for any threat or other suspicious activity along your path and compares it to the result of all watching players. 

If you travel at a *Fast Pace*, you do not benefit from the minimum result of 8 on your Keep Watch die roll. 

#### Navigate <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/west-direction-filled.png">
**Skill:** Intelligence (Navigator's tools) or Wisdom (Survival)

More often than not, a location of interest for a group of adventurers is not situated along a well trodden path, but hidden in the wilds behind obscure hints and directions.

If you wish to find your way through the wilds towards a specific location, you need to make a Navigation check at the Navigation DC. The Navigation DC is additionally modified by the information you possess to reach your destination:

| Detail of information | DC |
|:----------------------|:--:|
| Detailed map with travel hints | -5 |
| Outdated or simple map | 0 |
| Crude Map or general directions *(e.g. 40 <br>   miles north-west, near a small lake)* |  +5  |
| Obscure information *(e.g. follow the <br>  rising sun for 2 moons as the owl flies)*  | +10 |

If your navigation check fails by less than 5, you roughly travel towards your target, but not in the most direct way. Your travel speed is halved (rounded down) for this travel leg.

If your navigation check fails by 5 or more, you have made a mistake. Your travel speed is halved (rounded down) for this travel leg, however, you moved _away_ from your location.

If you rolled a total of 5 or lower, you got lost. Depending on the nature of your surroundings, getting lost might entail additional complications and dangers.

#### Scout <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/poison-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/napping-filled.png">
**Skill:** Intelligence (Investigation)

If your travel information is rather vague, or you are simply curious to see what else there is to see, you can scout ahead of the group. Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. The GM determines the DC for any noticeable things in the vicinity.

You might find such things as creatures waiting in ambush, favorable paths, or hidden locations.

#### Sneak
**Skill:** Dexterity (Stealth)

Sometimes you need to move quietly for a while to avert the eyes and ears of nearby enemies or to cover your tracks and take detours to shake off possible pursuers. Doing so does not require the whole party to perform the Sneak activity, as the party members that do so, can try to keep everyone else as stealthy as possible.

Add the Dexterity (Stealth) check results of all sneaking party members together and divide the sum by the number of players in the group (rounding down). This is the final and effective result for the group's efforts.

#### Track <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/west-direction-filled.png">
**Skill:** Wisdom (Survival)

Sometimes you don't try to find a specific location, but follow or chase another creature or group. Instead of the Navigation activity, make a Wisdom (Survival) check against the terrain DC to find and follow the tracks of your quarry. If your quarry is trying to cover their tracks, use the higher of their Sneak result or the terrain DC.

If your check fails by less than 5, you are having trouble following your quarry. Your travel speed is halved (rounded down) for this travel leg.

If your check fails by 5 or more, you have made a mistake. Your travel speed is halved (rounded down) for this travel leg, however, you moved away from your quarry.

If you rolled a total of 5 or lower, you got lost. Depending on the nature of your surroundings, getting lost might entail additional complications and dangers.

A different use for the Track activity is to read the tracks your group crosses during their travel, in order to glean what kind of creatures are roaming nearby. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check. The GM determines the DC for any possible tracks you might find and to which creatures they might belong.

#### Trailblaze <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/napping-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/west-direction-filled.png">
**Skill:** Strength (Athletics)

Traveling through difficult terrain slows you significantly. You can help your companions by clearing a clear path for them to follow. Make a Strength (Athletics) check against the terrain DC. If you succeed, the terrain's travel speed penalty is reduced by 1 mile per hour (to a minimum of 0).

If you succeed by 5 or more, the terrain's travel speed penalty is reduced by 2 miles per hour instead.

If you fail the check by less than 5, you still reduce the terrain's travel speed penalty by 1 mile per hour (to a minimum of 0), but you automatically suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the activity.

### Making Camp
The players must search the environment and find a proper location for setting up camp. Depending on the location, the camp can have different properties. If a character performed the *Scout* activity on the last leg, they may make an Intelligence (Investigation) check, while characters that *Kept Watch* may make a Wisdom (Perception) check with disadvantage. For each 5 points of the best result among all rolls, the campsite has one or more properties, some even improved.

If none of the party took either activity, they need to spend an additional hour to find a suitable campsite.

| Campsite properties | Search Result |
|:-------------------:|:-------------:|
| 0 |  1–5 |
| +1st Property | 6–10 |
| +2nd Property | 11–15 |
| +3rd Property | 16–20 |
| Improve any 1 | 21–25 |
| Improve any 2 | 26–30 |

The GM rolls a d6 on the table below to decide what campsite properties are found first, second and third.

| d6 | 1st Property | 2nd Property | 3rd Property |
|:--:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| 1 | Comfortable | Defendable | Hidden |
| 2 | Comfortable | Hidden | Defendable |
| 3 | Defendable | Comfortable | Hidden |
| 4 | Defendable | Hidden | Comfortable |
| 5 | Hidden | Comfortable | Defendable |
| 6 | Hidden | Defendable | Comfortable |

If you are not content with the campsites you found, you must travel on for another hour (risking a forced march), in order to search again. Once night sets in, you can search by *Scouting* using Intelligence (Investigation) with disadvantage.

#### Comfortable
*The campsite is reasonably protected against all but the harshest weather.* You regain half your maximum hit dice (rounded down, minimum 1) and reduce your exhaustion level by one after completing a long rest (as usual).

In an *Uncomfortable* location you only regain one quarter of your maximum hit dice (rounded down, minimum 0) and don't reduce your exhaustion level.

#### Defencible
*The campsite has a natural barrier or is otherwise difficult to reach (e.g. inside the canopy of a large tree or up on a rock ledge).* The party entering the camp for the first time and other approaching creatures need to succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to enter the camp.

This property can be improved on a Search Result of 20 and more, increasing the DC to enter the campsite to 20.

#### Hidden
*The campsite is removed or obscured from prying eyes (e.g. a cave behind a waterfall or under the leaves of a huge willow tree).* Approaching creatures need to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to find your camp.

This property can be improved on a Search Result of 20 or more, increasing the DC to find the campsite to 20.

### Camp Activities
Once a party sets down to rest, players can choose one or more of the following activities. Each activity takes roughly 1 hour, i.e. each player can perform one of these activities during a short rest, or two activities during a typical long rest of 8 hours (6 hours of sleep and 2 hours of light activity).

You may always expend hit dice to regain lost hit points, but you can take a special camp activity to accelerate your recovery (*Tend to the Wounded*).

#### Attune Magic Item <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png">
**Skill:** none

Attuning to one magical item takes time and concentration. You must have identified the item's magical properties before you can attune to it.

#### Camouflage Camp <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/west-direction-filled.png">
**Skill:** Dexterity (Stealth)

You can gather and use natural materials like rocks or foliage to hide your campsite. A successful DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check adds the *Hidden* property to your campsite if it doesn't have it. 

#### Cook Hearty Meal <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/west-direction-filled.png">
**Skill:** Wisdom (Cook's utensils)

A good night's rest is not guaranteed when camping in the wilds and a fine cooked meal can go a long way to remedy this fact. Make a DC 15 Wisdom (Cook's utensils) check. <br>You need one fresh ration of food for every person that will partake of the meal, as well as a reasonable amount of seasoning. If you provide at least 50% more fresh rations than necessary, you gain advantage on this check. If you can only provide half the required amount of rations (but not less), you gain disadvantage.

If you succeed, each person partaking of your meal regains a quarter of their maximum hit dice (rounded down, min 1). If you fail, the meal is edible, but not refreshing. If you rolled a total of 5 or lower, the whole meal is spoiled and its rations are wasted.

You can only benefit from one hearty meal per long rest.

#### Fortify Camp <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/west-direction-filled.png">
**Skill:** Strength (Athletics)

You can use wooden spikes or large boulders to barricade your campsite or dig a ditch and build ramparts. A successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check adds the *Defendable* property to your campsite if it doesn't already have it. 

#### Hunt/Forage <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/poison-filled.png">
**Skill:** Wisdom (Survival)

Gather food and water or hunt local game.  This is the same action as the *Hunt & Forage* travel activity. However, since you are not traveling at this point, you may make the corresponding Wisdom (Survival) check with advantage.

#### Keep Watch
**Skill:** Wisdom (Perception)

A long rest requires at least 6 hours of sleep and 2 hours of light activity. Depending on the size of the traveling party, you are advised to take shifts keeping watch whilst the others try to gain some sleep. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check. If your result is 7 or lower, you can take 8 instead. Players who perform one of the other camp activities (i.e. not sleeping or keeping watch) do not benefit from a minimum of 8 on the roll.

The GM determines the DC for any threat or approaching danger (hostile creatures or natural phenomena) and compares it to all Wisdom (Perception) results. On a success, the watchers are able to wake and warn the rest of the party, and prevent being surprised.

#### Set up Traps <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/west-direction-filled.png">
**Skill:** Wisdom (Survival)

You can set a number of small traps like caltrops, slings, and small pits around your camp. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check. The DC to find these traps with an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check is equal to the result of your Wisdom (Survival) check. The attack bonus of their effects is equal to the result of your Wisdom (Survival) check minus 10. 

#### Rest and Recuperate
**Skill:** Wisdom (Medicine)

You take your time to catch your breath properly, eat and drink, and dress your wounds. Make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If you succeed, treat any hit dice rolled to determine the hit points you regain as having rolled their maximum value during this rest. If you suffer from a sickness or disease, it has disadvantage to attack you during your long rest.

#### Tend to the Wounded <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png">
**Skill:** Wisdom (Medicine)

You go around camp, making sure that the wounds of up to six creatures other than yourself are properly cleaned and dressed. Make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check for each patient, in order to assess the wounds and properly dress them. This consumes one use of a healer's kit per creature tended to.

If you succeed, your patient can treat any hit dice rolled to determine the hit points that they regain as having rolled their maximum value, during this rest. If your patient suffers from a sickness or disease, it has disadvantage to attack them during their long rest. 

#### Train <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png">
**Skill:** Varies

You dedicate time to training and self-improvement. This might be spell research, practicing a skill, subskill or language, or any other training activity that can normally be performed during downtime. If you succeed at the appropriate check, you gain two hours of progress towards your goal.

### Mounted Travel
Using mounts or vehicles (such as carts and wagons) you can significantly shorten travel time, up to maximum distance per travel leg using normal pace.

###### Travel Pace of Mounts

| Pace | Cost | Speed | Max.Distance| Capacity |
|:-----|:-----|:-----:|:-----------:|---------:|
| Pony | 50 gp | 5 per hour| 18 miles| 225 lb |
| Mastiff | 25 gp | 4 per hour| 12 miles| 195 lb |
| Musk Ox | 30 gp | 4 per hour| 15 miles| 700 lb |
| Donkey | 8 gp | 5 per hour| 18 miles| 420 lb |
| Riding Horse| 75 gp | 8 per hour| 30 miles| 480 lb |
| War Horse| 400 gp | 8 per hour| 30 miles| 540 lb |
| Draft Horse | 50 gp | 6 per hour| 25 miles| 540 lb |
| Mammoth | 200 gp | 4 per hour| 15 miles| 1500 lb |
| Camel | 50 gp | 4 per hour| 15 miles| 480 lb |
| Carriage | 100 gp | 4 per hour| 15 miles| 1500 lb |
| Cart, wagon | 15 gp | 4 per hour| 12 miles| 480 lb |

Animals need feed (per day) or can find some themselves with a Wisdom (Survival) check at a DC based on the *Hunt & Forage* table for 1 Ration. Animals who hunger or thirst for longer than 2 days suffer one level of Exhaustion per day at the end of their long rest. 

###### Feed Costs (per day)

| Type | Cost | Weight 
|:------|:---------------|:------|
| Herbivores (hay, barley) | 5 cp | 10 lb.| 
| Omnivore (disposed food) | 10 cp | 5 lb.| 
| Carnivore (by-products, entrails) | 25 cp | 3 lb.| 

Mounts can pull five times their typical carrying capacity minus the weight of the vehicle. Mounts pulling carts or wearing armour may not travel more than two travel legs in a row without rest and suffer a disadvantage to the Forced March check. Travel groups that use wagons have access to the Drive Wagon travel activity, below.

#### Drive Wagon <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/FFFFFF/west-direction-filled.png">
**Skill:** Intelligence (Vehicle proficiency) or Dexterity (Animal Handling)

You stay at the front of the wagon, maintaining a steady pace for the animals and avoiding road obstacles that slow down or damage the carriage. Make a Dexterity (Animal Handling) check against the Navigation DC. Increase the DC by 5 if you are traveling off-road, without a clear trail or road. 

If your check succeeds by 5 or more, you may increase the travel pace by 1 mile per hour for the rest of the travel leg.

If your check fails by 10 or more or is a critical failure, a cart wheel breaks. Repairing a cart is a Focused activity requiring a successful DC 15 Intelligence check and takes a full travel leg. Players with proficiency in Smith, Carpenter, Woodcarver, or Tinker's tools add their proficiency bonus. 

### Perils of Travel

#### Starvation
Players can survive without food for 3 + Constitution Modifier Days. At the end of a day beyond that limit, you are starving and automatically suffer one level of exhaustion. Eating food resets the count of days since starvation.

##### What's In A Ration?
Hard tack, dried and cured meats, cheeses, and dried grains form the basis of traveler's rations. These rations last for 10 days before spoiling, making them valuable choices for purchase compared to fresh meats which spoil after a day.

#### Dehydration
Hot weather and deserts doubles water intake need to 2 pints per travel leg. Players who can only drink half their daily water intake, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution (Endurance) check or suffer two levels of exhaustion. If a player drinks no water for the whole day, they automatically suffer two levels of exhaustion.

##### Desperate Measures
You can quench thirst by eating raw meat or fresh plants. Each 2 pints of fresh blood or 1 pound of fresh plants counts as 1 pint of water.

You can drink dirty water or blood from a carcass, it makes an attack with a +5 bonus vs your Constitution defence. On a hit, you vomit and the next sickness attack vs your Constitution defence has advantage. 

#### Sickness
At the end of each day of travel, sickness makes an attack with a +2 bonus vs the Constitution defence of every character. If the party is travelling in hazardous weather (arctic or winter) or terrain (jungle or swamp) or somebody in the party already suffers from a contagious disease, then the attack has advantage. Remember that camp activities such as *Rest and Recuperate* and *Tend to the Wounded* help to negate this advantage. If you fail, record the failure. If you succeed, remove all recorded failures so far.

If you record two failures in a row, you come down with a minor sickness such as the common cold. More of an annoyance than anything else.

If you record three failures in a row, you get sick from a regional sickness such as flu or malaria. While sickened, you suffer from disadvantage to Dexterity and Wisdom checks until you recover. Magic such as lesser restoration helps you recover immediately.

If you record four or more failures in a row, you are really sick from a rare regional disease such as plague or dengue fever. While sickened, you suffer one permanent level of exhaustion until you recover. GMs may impose other risks, including death.

### Hunting and Gathering
These tables help the GM to come up with quick results to player actions based on terrain and circumstances.

#### Foraging - Water
When making a *Hunt & Forage* travel activity for water, you may apply the following modifiers:

| Terrain | DC |
|:-------:|:--:|
| Tundra, Snowfall/Winter | No check needed |
| Mountain Peak, Sub-Arctic | No check needed |

#### Hunting
When making a *Hunt & Forage* travel activity for a game, the GM may let the players roleplay actual hunting. If they choose to, use the following tables to identify, track and kill the prey. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check against the Track DC, and then an Attack Roll against the Kill DC to take down each individual prey with the appropriate weapon (usually, a ranged weapon). You have advantage on one of the Attack rolls if you beat the Track DC by 5 or more prior making the killing shot.

Each terrain table has 17 safe encounters and 3 combat encounters. In combat encounters, players can withdraw or must fight the creature. Depending on how dangerous your environment is, you may change safe encounters into appropriate combat encounters.

#### Fishing
Fishing is a time-consuming activity that requires a whole travel leg (3-5 hours) to be spent near the bank of a river or a lake. For every travel leg spent fishing, the player rolls a DC 12 Survival check. If successful, the GM rolls on the following table. 

Subtract 5 from the result (minimum 1) if fishing in a River, or subtract 10 from the result (minimum 1) if fishing in a Pool or a Small Lake.

### Creating Hazards
The following rules let the GM quickly design and resolve blizzards, hailstorms, avalanches and earthquakes. Choose the appropriate tier for your party and the danger level of the hazard: setback, dangerous or deadly. Each hazard has an associated defence (usually Dexterity or Constitution) that it attacks. 

On a hit, the character takes damage appropriate for their level tier. On a miss, they take half of that damage. On a critical hit, follow the rules for a critical hit with an attack. On a critical miss, they take no damage. 

###### Hazard Attack Bonuses

| Hazard Danger Level | Attack Bonus |
|:--------------------|:------------:|
| Setback | +3 to +5 |
| Dangerous | +6 to +8 |
| Deadly | +9 to +12 |

###### Damage Severity by Level

| Character Level | Setback | Dangerous | Deadly |
|:---------------:|:-------:|:---------:|:------:|
| 1st-4th | 1d10 | 2d10 | 4d10 |
| 5th-10th | 2d10 | 4d10 | 10d10 |
| 11th-16th | 4d10 | 10d10 | 18d10 |
| 17th-20th | 10d10 | 18d10 | 24d10 |

#### Hazard Examples

##### Avalanches, Rockfalls and Mudslides
*Any Level of Hazard*

The hazard makes an attack vs the Dexterity defence of any character in the area where the it occurs. On a hit, a creature takes bludgeoning damage and is buried by the hazard, or half as much damage on a miss. The area is filled with snow, rubble or mud and becomes difficult terrain.

Any buried creature is considered suffocated, and it can dig through to free itself. To do so, the creature must succeed a number of Strength (Athletics) checks, as shown in the following table.

| Hazard Level | Number of Checks |
|:-------------|:----------------:|
| Setback  | 2 |
| Dangerous  | 3 |
| Deadly | 4 |

##### Blizzard
*Setback Hazard*

The area affected by a blizzard is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the blizzard for one hour, the blizzard makes an attack vs its Constitution defence. On a hit, the creature takes cold damage, or half as much damage on a miss. If a creature is wearing warm clothing, the blizzard has disadvantage on the attack roll.

##### Earthquakes
*Any Level of Hazard*

A tremor shakes the area. The earthquake makes an attack vs the Dexterity defence of each creature on the ground in that area. On a hit, the creature is knocked prone.

The hazard level is determined by the proximity to the epicentre or the intensity of the earth tremor:
* **Setback.** Far from the epicentre or light earthquake.
* **Dangerous.** Near the epicentre or moderate earthquake.
* **Deadly.** Very close to the epicentre or severe earthquake.

##### Hailstorm
*Dangerous Hazard*

Similar to a blizzard, the terrain affected by the hailstorm is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the hailstorm for one hour, the hailstorm makes an attack vs its Constitution defence. On a hit, the creature takes cold damage, or half as much damage on a miss.

##### Insect Swarm
*Setback Hazard*

A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere. The swarm moves 20 feet each round. When a creature enters the cloud, the cloud makes an attack vs its Constitution defence. On a hit, it takes piercing damage, or half as much damage on a miss. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud is attacked again. A creature cannot be damaged by the insect swarm if it’s wielding a torch or if it is at least 5 feet from a fire. 

##### Lava
*Deadly Hazard*

The lava is considered difficult terrain. Any creature that enters the lava takes fire damage. A creature that ends its turn in the lava takes fire damage.

##### Lightning Storms
*Dangerous or Deadly Hazard*

The GM rolls a d20 to determine if any creature is struck by lightning. This check can be made at the beginning of each turn during combat or at any time while the party is not in combat. The creatures hit by lightning are determined by the GM, and any creature in the area under total cover from above cannot take damage.

| d20 | Number of Creatures |
|:---:|:-------------------:|
| 1-10 | 0 |
| 11-14 | 1d4 |
| 15-17 | 1d6 |
| 18-19 | 1d8 |
| 20 | 1d10 |

##### Magma Eruptions
*Dangerous Hazard*

Magma erupts from a point on the ground, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. The geyser makes an attack vs the Dexterity defence of each creature in its area. On a hit, the creature takes fire damage, or half as much on a miss.

##### Poison Clouds and Spores
*Setback Hazard*

The cloud makes an attack vs the creature's Constitution defence when upon entering the cloud. On a hit, the creature takes poison damage, or half as much damage on a miss. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud is attacked again.

##### Rapids
*Setback Hazard*

When a Large or smaller creature enters the rapids, it’s pushed 30 feet in the direction of the water flow. The rapids make an attack vs the creature's Strength defence. On a hit, the creature takes bludgeoning damage. Any creature caught by the rapids can make a Strength (Athletics) check to swim out of the rapids.

##### Rogue Wave
*Dangerous Hazard*

A large and unexpected wave that can be extremely dangerous. When a creature is hit by the rogue wave, the wave makes an attack roll vs the creature's Strength defence. On a hit, the creature takes bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a miss. The rogue wave, along with any creatures in it, moves in a straight line at a speed of 50 feet per turn, and any Huge or smaller creature inside the wave is attacked. The wave damage is reduced by 1d10 on each subsequent round. When the damage is reduced to 0, the wave ends.

A creature caught by the wave can move by swimming and it can make a Strength (Athletics) check to swim out of the wave.

##### Sandstorms
*Dangerous Hazard*

The sandstorm makes an attack roll vs the Constitution defence of any creature inside it. On a hit, the creature is blinded until the sandstorm ends. A creature can make a Constitution check at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The DC is equal to 10 + the sandstorm's attack bonus and if the creature is proficient in Constitution defence, then it may add its proficiency bonus to the check. A creature cannot be blinded by the sandstorm if it’s wearing goggles or something that protects its eyes.

Any check that relies on sight is made with disadvantage for the duration of the sandstorm.

##### Unsteady Ground
*Setback Hazard*

The floor in the area is considered difficult terrain. Any creature on the ground that starts moving on its turn while in the area must succeed on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. If a creature uses a Dash action, it must make another check.
