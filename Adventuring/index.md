# Adventuring
Delving into the ancient Underway, slipping through the back alleys of Beschcadik, hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles of Lelistrel; these are the things that adventures are made of. Your character in the game might explore forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.

This section covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this section, along with a discussion of the activities your character might pursue between adventures.

Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex relationships of a royal court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the bookâ€™s introduction:
1. The GM describes the environment.
2. The players describe what they want to do.
2. The GM narrates the results of their actions.

Typically, the GM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters' progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions. The GM's notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers' actions determine what happens, so the GM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.
