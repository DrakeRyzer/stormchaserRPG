# Slowed
* Slowed always includes a value, such as "Slowed (1)"
* When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number of actions that you regain by your slowed value. Since slowed has its effect at the start of your turn, you don't immediately lose actions if you become slowed during your turn.
