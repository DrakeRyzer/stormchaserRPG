# Panicked
An unspeakable dread can break the will of weaker creatures and send them running for their lives. 

* A panicked creature remains panicked as long as it is frightened. If it is no longer frightened, it stops panicking. 
* A panicked creature must disengage or dash with all of its movement speed away from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters. The creature uses the dodge action anytime it can and will attack or interact with obstacles and use special abilities, including spells, as a means of escape. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack. 
* At the start of its turn, a panicking creature can attempt a Wisdom defence check at the DC of the source of the fear. If it succeeds, it is no longer panicked. It may continue to feign panicking to surprise any pursuers.
* A panicked creature cannot concentrate on spells.
