# Broken
Items that have taken damage in excess of half their total hit points gain the broken condition, meaning they are less effective at their designated task. The broken condition has the following effects, depending upon the item.

* If the item is a weapon, any attacks made with the item suffer disadvantage on attack and damage rolls. The weapon loses all properties except ammunition, concealed, limit, loading, long, mag, misfire, pellets, slow, strength, two-handed, unwieldy, versatile and worn until repaired.
* If the item is a suit of armour or a shield, the bonus it grants to AC or DR is halved, rounding down.
* If the item is a tool needed for a skill, any skill check made with the item suffers disadvantage.
* If the item is a wand or staff, it uses up twice as many charges when used.

If the item does not fit into any of these categories, the broken condition has no effect on its use.

Items with the broken condition, regardless of type, are worth 75% of their normal value. Items can be repaired using a spell such as mending, or with the tools used to create them. You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the itemâ€™s price. Alternatively, you can make a DC 20 tools check to invest only one hour of work per point of damage to be repaired. Items lose the broken condition restore to half their original hit points or higher.

If the item is magical, it can only be repaired in combination with an arcana check of the same DC as that required to identify the item.
