# Restrained
* A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
* The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity defence checks.
* A creature that has been restrained via a grapple remains restrained as long as it is also grappled. If the grapple breaks, it is no longer restrained.
* You can spend one of your attacks to make an unarmed attack roll vs the strength or dexterity defence (target's choice) of a creature that you are restraining. If you succeed, the creatured is pinned by you. If you fail, the grapple is broken and the creature makes an opportunity attack against you.
