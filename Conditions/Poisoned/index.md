# Poisoned
* A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
* When a poisoned creature takes poison damage equal to or greater than its Constitution modifier (minimum of one), its hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6.
* While poisoned, if a creature's hit point maximum is reduced below half than normal it suffers one level of exhaustion that cannot be removed. This exhaustion persists even if the creature is no longer poisoned, as long as its hit point maximum is reduced below half.
* A creature's hit point maximum recovers at the end of a long rest, as long as it is no longer poisoned during the rest. Healing using hit dice or magical means also recovers the same amount of the creature's hit point maximum.
