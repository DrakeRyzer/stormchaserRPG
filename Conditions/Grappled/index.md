# Grappled
* A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
* If an effect would remove the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, it must roll vs the Strength defence of the grappler to end the grapple.
* Attacks targeting a grappling or grappled creature are at disadvantage, unless a light or natural weapon is used.
* A grappled creature has disadvantage to hit creatures that are not grappling it.
* You can spend one of your attacks to make an unarmed attack roll vs the strength or dexterity defence (target's choice) of a creature that you are grappling. If you succeed, the creature is restrained by you. If you fail, the grapple is broken and the creature makes an opportunity attack against you.
