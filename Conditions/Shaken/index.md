# Shaken
A shaken creature is dealing with the initial shock from a horrifying sight or a powerful enemy attack. Unless stated otherwise, the effect ends on the end of your next turn.

* A shaken creature has disadvantage on its first attack roll or ability check on its turn.
* If a shaken creature is subjected to an effect that causes it to become shaken again, it becomes frightened.
