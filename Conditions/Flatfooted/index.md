# Flat-Footed
You're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. Melee and ranged attacks have +1d to hit you. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others (especially conditions) can make you universally flatfooted against everything. If a rule doesnâ€™t specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "the target is flat-footed".
