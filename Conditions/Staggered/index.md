* A staggered creature's speed is halved. Any increases to the creature's speed are added before halving it.
* The target cannot take the [Dodge](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Dodge/) or [Step](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Step/) actions.
