# Staggered
* A staggered creature's speed is halved. Any increases to the creature's speed are added before halving it.
* The target cannot take the [dodge](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Dodge/) or [step](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Step/) actions.
* If a staggered creature is hit by an effect that causes staggered, the affected creature immediately falls [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/).
