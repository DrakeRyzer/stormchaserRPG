# Persistent Damage
* Persistent damage comes from effects like acid, being on fire, or many other situations. It appears as “X persistent [type] damage,” where “X” is the amount of damage dealt and “[type]” is the damage type. Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw. Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you have the condition. After you take persistent damage, roll a DC 15 flat check to see if you recover from the persistent damage. If you succeed, the condition ends.
* An adjacent creature can attempt to assist in removing this effect. This usually takes the form of smothering flames, washing off acid, covering a wound, etc. The creature spends 2 actions and rolls the flat DC 15 check with +1d. On a success, the Condition ends.
* Resistances, Vulnerabilities, or Immunities apply to Persistent Damage.
* Multiple sources of Persistent Damage can apply at the same time, but only the highest damage of a particular type applies.
   * If a character is splashed with Alchemist's Fire for 2 Persistent Fire Damage, then splashed with acid for 1 Persistent Acid Damage, they would take 2 Persistent Fire Damage and 1 Persistent Acid Damage at the end of each turn and need to remove each with successful checks.
   * If a character is hit by a Red Dragon's fire breath and takes 5 Persistent Fire Damage, then a Mage's Fireball spell and takes 3 Persistent Fire Damage, they would only take 5 Persistent Fire Damage and need to remove it with one successful check.
