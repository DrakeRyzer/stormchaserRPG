# Pain-Wracked
The creature is experiencing excruciating pain that inhibits its ability to maintain control over its actions. It can suffer the pain-wracked condition along with ongoing damage due to burning alive, dissolving into acid, being eaten by a swarm of bugs or rats, extreme torture or surgery without anaesthesia, or when its mind is crushed by a powerful psychic entity. 

* A pain-wracked creature suffers disadvantage on all skill checks and attack rolls, and its movement speed is decreased by 10.
* A pain-wracked creature does not benefit from any Dexterity or shield bonuses to its defence.
* At the start of its turn, a pain-wracked creature must make a DC 15 Constitution defence check. If it fails the defence check, it must use its action to attempt to cancel the ongoing damage, and cannot use its bonus action until the start of its next turn. If it fails by 5 or more, it also can only use its movement to flee in a direction away from the source of pain and drops prone if it enters difficult terrain or obstacles. If it fails by 10 or more, it always drops prone after using its movement action. The action required to cancel the ongoing damage must be a defence check with an appropriate attribute. The DC is either 10 + the attack bonus associated with the source of the pain or, if nothing else applies, either 15 or half the damage taken since the end of the previous turn, whichever is higher.
* If a creature manages to remove the source of pain or the ongoing damage effect ends, it is no longer pain-wracked.
* A pain-wracked creature that drops unconscious or is dying cannot be stabilised unless it is no longer pain-wracked.
