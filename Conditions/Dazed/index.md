# Dazed
Dazed is a lesser variant of stunned. You may become dazed after taking taking massive damage or when a stunning effect misses by one. Unless stated otherwise, the effect ends on the end of your next turn.
* A Dazed creature cannot make opportunity attacks and may use either an action or a bonus action but not both.
* Regardless of your abilities or effects, you cannot make more than one melee or ranged attack during your turn.
* If a dazed creature is subjected to an effect that causes it to become dazed again, the creature becomes stunned.
