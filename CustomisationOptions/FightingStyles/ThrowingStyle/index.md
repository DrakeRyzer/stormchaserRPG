# Throwing

## Style
You are skilled with the techniques of throwing weapons. While you are wielding a weapon with the thrown property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- Whenever you make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can immediately draw another weapon as part of the attack.
- Whenever you make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can move up to 5 feet.
- When you miss with a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack against a creature within 15 feet and behind your initial target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll.

## Mastery
You've mastered the techniques of throwing weapons, readily blending the weapons with your movements. While you are wielding a weapon with the thrown property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls with thrown weapons.
- Once on each of your turns, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a thrown weapon against a target within the weapon's normal range without the aid of your proficiency bonus (no action required).
- When you hit a creature with a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you have advantage on your next melee weapon attack against that creature before the end of your next turn.
- Once per turn, you can draw a weapon with the thrown property without using your object interaction.
