# Sharpshooter

## Style
You are skilled with ranged weapons and can make shots that others find difficult. While you are wielding a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- You can use your bonus action to mark a target 30 feet or greater from you. If you do so, and that target moves at least 5 feet before the start of your next turn, they provoke an opportunity attack from you, and you can use a ranged weapon for that opportunity attack.
- Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover against targets 30 feet or greater from you.

## Mastery
You've mastered ranged weapons and can easily make shots that others find impossible. While you are wielding a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
- Your ranged weapon attacks half cover against targets 30 feet or greater from you. If your ranged weapon attacks would already ignore half cover against targets 30 feet or greater from you, they also ignore three-quarters cover.
- Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, your weapon dice deal maximum damage.
