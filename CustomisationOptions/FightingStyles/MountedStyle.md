# Mounted

## Style
You are skilled at fighting while mounted. You gain the following benefits:
- Mounting a creature only uses 5 feet of your movement, provided you can reach it.
- You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead, provided you are a valid target for that attack.

## Mastery
You've mastered the art of fighting while mounted, moving seamlessly with your companion. While you are mounted on a controlled creature, you gain the following benefits:
- Once per turn, you can choose to have advantage on a melee weapon attack roll against an unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount. If the attack hits, you deal additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
- Each round, the first time that your mount is subjected to an effect that targets its Dexterity defence and deals only half damage on a miss, it instead takes no damage if it is missed and only half damage if it is hit.
- While mounted, you can use your bonus action to have your mount make a single attack.
