# Dual Wielding

## Style
You are skilled at fighting with two weapons. While you are wielding separate weapons in each hand with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of your Two-Weapon Fighting attack as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.
- When you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, if you are wielding two weapons with the parry property, then you may apply both of their parry bonuses to your Strength defence vs melee attacks.
- When you make an opportunity attack, you can attack with both of your weapons.

## Mastery
You've mastered fighting with two weapons, becoming a flurry of motion. While you are wielding separate weapons in each hand with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you may forgo a number of attacks. For each attack that you forgo, you gain a +1 bonus to Strength defence vs melee attacks until the start of your next turn.
- You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one-handed melee weapons you are wielding aren't finesse or light. Instead, these weapons may not be unwieldy or versatile.
- When you use your bonus action to attack with a weapon, you can choose to forgo your proficiency die. If you do so, you can make an additional attack with that weapon, also without your proficiency die.
