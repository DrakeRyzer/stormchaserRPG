# Sentinel

## Style
You are skilled at techniques that take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- Creatures provoke an opportunity attack when they move to within your reach or move 5 feet or greater while within your reach.
- When you hit a creature that is no more than one size larger than you with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.

## Mastery
You've mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard; in tight spaces you are indomitable. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- Creatures within your reach provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the disengage action.
- You can use a bonus action to enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you may make a number of opportunity attacks equal to your proficiency bonus.
- If you end your turn having taken the dodge action, then you may make one additional opportunity attack that round.
