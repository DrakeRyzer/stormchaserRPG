# Formation

## Style
You are skilled at fighting with a partner. While an ally is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- You can take the Guard action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Guard action as a bonus action, you can once per turn instead take it as a free action on your turn.
- When you move on your turn, you can use a bonus action to allow an ally within 5 feet of you to move with you (no action required by the ally). The ally must end this movement within 5 feet of you, and this movement can't exceed the ally's speed.
- When you choose to let an attack that would hit a guarded ally hit you instead, the creature rolls the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.

## Mastery
You've mastered fighting with a partner, learning to move and act as a single unit. While an ally is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- When a creature within your reach misses an ally of yours with a melee attack, it provokes an opportunity attack from you. Do not add your proficiency bonus to your weapon skill for the purposes of determining the defence check DC.
- Each round, the first time an ally within 5 feet of you is hit by a weapon attack and the result of the attack roll exceeds their defence by less than your proficiency bonus, the attack misses them.
- When you take the Guard action, attacks vs the guarded ally's Dexterity defence that would affect only them have disadvantage.
