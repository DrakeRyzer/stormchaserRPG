# Equilibrium

## Style
You are skilled at fighting without the confines of armour. While you are wearing light or no armour and not wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:
- You can use your bonus action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your next turn. When you do so, you gain a bonus to Dexterity defence against effects the target controls equal to half your Dexterity modifier (rounded up, minimum of +1) while marked. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.
- You have advantage on Dexterity checks to avoid being moved. Effects that would physically move you have disadvantage on their attack roll vs Dexterity defence.

## Mastery
You've mastered fighting without the confines of armour, treating combat as an elegant dance. While you are wearing light or no armour and not wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:
- When a creature misses you with a weapon attack, it provokes an opportunity attack from you. Do not add your proficiency bonus to your weapon skill for the purposes of determining the defence check DC.
- Each round, the first time that a creature hits you with a weapon attack, if advantage on your defence score would cause the attack to miss, then the attack misses.
- Once per round, if you are disarmed you catch the weapon immediately.
