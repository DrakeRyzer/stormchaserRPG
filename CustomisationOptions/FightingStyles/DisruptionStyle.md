# Disruption

## Style
You are skilled at fighting and interfering with spellcasters. You gain the following benefits:
- When you roll vs a creature's Constitution defence to break their concentration and miss, you can use your bonus action to reroll. You must use the new roll.
- Once per round, when a hostile creature attempts to cast a spell while within 5 feet of you, they must first make a Constitution defence check of DC = 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell isn't cast and any points are wasted.

## Mastery
You've mastered fighting and interfering with spellcasters, confounding their concentration. You gain the following benefits:
- When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see casts a spell, they provoke an opportunity attack from you.
- Whenever you roll vs a creature's Constitution defence to make them break their concentration, you can add your proficiency bonus to the roll.
- Spells cast by creatures that you can see have disadvantage to hit you if you've dealt damage to the spellcaster since the start of your last turn.
