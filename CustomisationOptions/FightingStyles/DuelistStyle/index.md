# Duelist

## Style
You are skilled in the art of fighting with a single weapon. While you are wielding a weapon in one hand with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you gain the following benefit:
- You have advantage on feint attempts.
- When you miss with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack against the same target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll.
- Once on each of your turns, drawing or stowing a one-handed weapon no longer requires your object interaction.

## Mastery
You've mastered the art of fighting with a single weapon, making one weapon feel like many. While you are wielding a weapon in one hand with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you gain the following benefits:
- When you take the Attack action, you can choose to attack with haste at the expense of accuracy. Your weapon attacks are made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you can make an additional weapon attack, also without your proficiency bonus. If you would make more than one attack when you take the Attack action, only one attack is made without your proficiency bonus.
- Each round, the first time that a creature hits you with a melee attack, if advantage on your defence score would cause the attack to miss, then the attack misses.
- You have advantage on ability checks to avoid being disarmed. Attempts to disarm you suffer disadvantage.
