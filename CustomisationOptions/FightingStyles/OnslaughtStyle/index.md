# Onslaught

## Style
You are skilled at using your momentum to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:
- You can take the Dash action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Dash action as a bonus action, you can once per turn instead take it as a free action on your turn.
- When you attempt to trip a creature, instead of making a Strength (Athletics) check, you can instead make an attack roll. If you are wielding your weapon in two hands, you make this attack roll with advantage.

## Mastery
You've mastered using your momentum to your advantage, effectively pummeling creatures into submission and keeping them down once they fall. You gain the following benefits:
- When a creature falls prone within 5 feet of you, it provokes an opportunity attack from you.
- When you would have advantage on a melee weapon attack due to a creature being prone, you can reroll one of the dice once.
- When a prone creature within 5 feet of you attempts to stand, they provoke an opportunity attack from you.
- Once on each of your turns, if you move at least 10 feet in a straight line towards a creature before hitting it with a melee weapon attack, you deal additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
