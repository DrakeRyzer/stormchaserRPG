# Guerrilla

## Style
You are skilled at maneuvering across the battlefield. You gain the following benefits:
- You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Disengage action as a bonus action, you can once per turn instead take it as a free action on your turn.
- When you take the Disengage action, you ignore non-magical difficult terrain, and you have advantage on the first ability check to avoid an effect that impairs your movement speed or forces you to move before the start of your next turn.

## Mastery
You've mastered maneuvering across the battlefield, sliding through openings that others might not see. You gain the following benefits:
- You can move through a hostile creature's space regardless of that creature's size.
- When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed (no action required) without provoking opportunity attacks from that creature.
- Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, another enemy of the creature is within 5 feet of it, and that enemy isn't incapacitated, you can deal additional damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
- Each round, the first time that a hostile creature moves until you are within their melee reach, you disengage as a free action and move half your speed away from them. If you encounter an obstacle or hazard, you take the shortest route around it. If this is not possible then you stop. If you could already disengage as a free action and move up to half your speed (such as if you are a Scout Rogue), then you also do this the second time that a hostile creature moves until you are within their melee reach.
