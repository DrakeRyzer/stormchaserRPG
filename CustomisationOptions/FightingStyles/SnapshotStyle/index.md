# Snapshot

## Style
You are skilled at getting up close and personal with ranged weapons. While you are wielding a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When making a ranged weapon attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. 
- Your ranged weapon attacks against targets within 30 feet of you consider the target's cover bonus to be reduced by one step. This feature stacks with others of its kind.
- When you roll a 1 on a ranged weapon damage die against a creature within 30 feet, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1.

## Mastery
You've mastered getting up close and personal with ranged weapons, maintaining both rate of fire and accuracy. While you are wielding a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When you take the Attack action targeting a creature within 30 feet, you can choose to attack rapidly at the expense of accuracy. Your ranged weapon attacks are made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you can use your bonus action to make an additional ranged weapon attack, also without your proficiency bonus. If you would make more than one attack when you take the Attack action, only one attack is made without your proficiency bonus.
- Your ranged weapon attacks against targets 30 feet or greater from you consider the target's cover bonus to be reduced by one step. This feature stacks with others of its kind.
- Other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move to within 30 feet of you, and you can use ranged weapons when making opportunity attacks.
