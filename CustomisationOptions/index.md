# Customisation Options
The combination of ability scores, species, class, and background defines your characterâ€™s capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do.

This section defines three sets of rules for customising your character: feats, fighting styles and weapon foci.
