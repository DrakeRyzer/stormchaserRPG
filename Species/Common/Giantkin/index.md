# Giantkin
At the highest mountain peaks, far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl, dwell the reclusive giantkin. Few folk can claim to have seen a giantkin and fewer still can claim friendship with one. Giantkin wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each giantkin with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.

## Age
Giantkin have life spans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.
