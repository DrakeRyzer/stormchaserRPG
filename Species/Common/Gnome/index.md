# Gnome
Gnomes are distant relatives of the fey and their history tells of a time when they lived in the fey’s mysterious realm. A place where colors are brighter, the wildlands wilder and emotions more primal. Unknown forces drove the ancient gnomes from that realm long ago, forcing them to seek refuge in the material world. Despite this, the gnomes have never completely abandoned their fey roots or adapted to mortal culture. Though gnomes are no longer truly fey, their fey heritage can be seen in their innate magic powers, their oft-capricious natures and their outlooks on life and the world.

## Age
Gnomes mature at the same as elves and dwarves, but most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.

## Appearance
Gnomes are one of the smallest of the common races, generally standing just over 3 feet in height. Despite their small frames, however, gnomes are extremely resilient and not as weak as many of their foes assume. Though their diminutive stature reduces their ability to move quickly, gnomes often train to take advantage of their size, especially when fighting foes much larger than themselves.

The colouration of gnomes varies so wildly that many outsiders assume gnomes commonly use dyes and illusions to change their skin and hair tones. While gnomes are certainly not above cosmetic enhancement (and may wish to change their appearance just to see how outlandish they can look), their natural hues truly range over a rainbow of coloration. Their hair tends toward vibrant colors such as the fiery orange of autumn leaves, the verdant green of forests at springtime, or the deep reds and purples of wildflowers in bloom. Similarly, their flesh tones range from earthy browns to floral pinks, and gnomes with black, pastel blue, or even green skin are not unknown. Gnomes’ colouration has little regard for heredity, with the color of a gnome’s parents and other kin having no apparent bearing on the gnome’s appearance. Gnomes possess highly mutable facial characteristics, and their proportions often don’t match the norm of other humanoid races. Many have overly large mouths and eyes, an effect which can be both disturbing and stunning, depending on the individual. Others may have extremely small features spread over an otherwise blank expanse of face, or may mix shockingly large eyes with a tiny, pursed mouth and a pert button of a nose. Gnomes rarely take pride in or show embarrassment about their features, but members of other races often fixate on a gnome’s most prominent feature and attempt to use it as the focus of insults or endearments.

## Features
Your gnome character has certain features in common with all other gnomes.

### Attribute Score Increase
Your Dexterity and Constitution scores increase by 1.

### Gnome Cunning
You have +1d to your mental defences vs magic.

### Low-Light Vision
You can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light.

### Natural Illusionist
You know the [Minor Illusion](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Illusion/#minor-illusion) cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. If you are a spellcaster, then this cantrip does not count towards your total number of cantrips known.

## Phenotypes

### Deep Gnome
Deep gnomes are wiry and lean with bodies as hard as a slab of rock. Males are completely bald and beardless, while the females typically have grey hair. Deep gnome complexions are sometimes described as "gnarled" and are commonly dark in hue, with most deep gnomes demonstrating brown or gray skin with dark gray eyes.

Deep gnome adventurers are rare. Check with your Game Master to see if you can play one.

#### Infravision
Accustomed to darkness, you benefit from [infravision](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Special/#infravision).

#### Sunlight Sensitivity
You have -1d on attack rolls and on Perception checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

### Forest Gnome
Forest gnome skin is an earthy colour and looks, in many ways, like wood, although it is not particularly tough. Forest gnome hair is brown or black, although it grays with age, sometimes to a pure white.

### Rock Gnome
Rock gnomes possess a natural brownish tint to their skin. The presence or absence of light has little effect upon it. Young rock gnomes possess any of a large number of hair colours that fade to gray or white upon reaching adulthood.
