# Orc
Orcs are aggressive, callous and domineering. Bullies by nature, they respect strength and power as the highest virtues. On an instinctive level, orcs believe that they are entitled to anything that they want unless someone stronger can stop them from seizing it.

## Age
Orcs reach adulthood at age 12 and live up to 50 years.

## Appearance
Powerfully built, orcs typically stand just a few inches taller than most humans but have much greater muscle mass. Their broad shoulders and thick, brawny hips often give them a slightly lurching gait. They typically have dull green skin, coarse dark hair, beady red eyes and protruding, tusk-like teeth. Many orcs consider scars a mark of distinction and use them as a form of body art.
