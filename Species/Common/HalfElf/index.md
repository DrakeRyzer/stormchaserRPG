# Half Elf
Elves have long drawn the covetous gazes of other races. Their generous lifespans, magical affinity and inherent grace each contribute to the admiration or bitter envy of their neighbours. However, of all their traits, none so entrance their human associates as their beauty. Since the two races first came into contact with each other, humans have held up elves as models of physical perfection, seeing in these fair folk idealised versions of themselves. For their part, many elves find humans attractive, despite their comparatively barbaric ways, and are drawn to the passion and impetuosity with which members of the younger race play out their brief lives.

Sometimes this mutual infatuation leads to romantic relationships. Though usually short-lived, even by human standards, such trysts may lead to the birth of half-elves, a race descended from two cultures yet inheritor of neither. Half-elves can breed with one another, but even these "pure-blood" half-elves tend to be viewed as bastards by humans and elves alike. Caught between destiny and derision, half-elves often view themselves as the middle children of the world.

## Age
Physically, half-elves mature sightly slower than humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 18. They also live much longer than humans, often exceeding 180 years.

## Appearance
Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin colour is normally dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes feature an exotic range of colours from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. However, this pattern changes for half-elves of dark elf descent. Such elves are almost unfailingly marked with the white or silver hair of the drow parent and, more often than not, have dusky gray skin that takes on a purplish or bluish tinge in the right light, while their eye colour usually favors that of the human parent.
