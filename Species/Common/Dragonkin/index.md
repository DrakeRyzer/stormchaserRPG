Your attribute bonus, breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by your draconic ancestry, as shown in the table above. Additionally, your draconic ancestry grants you one of the following features:

### Red/Gold: Emperor's Awe
You may choose either the Intimdiation (Savagery) or Persuasion (Leadership) subskill and increase it by one level.

### Blue/Bronze: Cloud Step
Sand and water are not considered difficult terrain and you can walk upon them as if on solid ground

### Green/Brass: Conversationalist
You can speak, read, and write one additional language of your choice.

### Black/Copper: Dragon's Den
You gain a burrowing speed of 30 ft and can hold your breath for 1 hour.

### White/Silver: Ice Walk
You can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain made of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.

### Gemstone: Psionic Mind
You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature,  but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.

## Breath Weapon
As a bonus action, or as a replacement for one of your attacks when you take the attack action, you can exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

When you use your breath weapon, make a proficient Constitution attack roll vs each creature in the area. The Defence that the target uses is determined by your draconic ancestry. On a hit, a creature takes 1d6 damage for every 2 character levels that you have, or half as much damage on a miss.

You can use your breath weapon a number of times equal to half your Constitution modifier (round up, minimum of 1), as shown on the table below. The number of uses resets when you complete a short or a long rest.

| Constitution Score | Uses/Rest |
|:------------------:|:---------:|
| 15 or less | 1 |
| 16-19| 2 |
| 20 | 3 |

## Damage Resistance
You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

## Languages
You can speak. read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.
