# Dragonkin
Born of dragons, the dragonkin walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Some dragonkin are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars and many others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

## Age
Young dragonkin grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3 and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.

## Alignment
Dragonkin have an innate inclination towards certain alignments (see the phenotype table).

## Appearance
Dragonkin are draconic humanoids that stand erect on two feet, although most lack wings. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to six-and-a-half feet tall and weighing three hundred pounds or more, with coloured scales that match those of the draconic family from which they are descended. Their hands and feet bear strong, talon-like claws.

## Features
Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of features that you share with other dragonkin.

### Attribute Score Increase
Your Strength score rises by 2.

### Breath Weapon
As an action you can exhale destructive energy. Your phenotype determines the size, shape, and damage of the exhalation.

When you use your breath weapon, make a trained Constitution attack roll vs each creature in the area. The defence that the target uses is determined by your draconic ancestry. On a hit, a creature takes damage according to the phenotype table, or half as much damage on a miss.

You can use your breath weapon a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. The number of uses resets when you complete a short or a long rest.

### Damage Resistance
You have resistance to the damage type associated with your phenotype.

### Dragon Senses
You have [infravision](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Special/#infravision).
