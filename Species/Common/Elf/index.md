# Elf
The long-lived elves are children of the natural world, similar in many superficial ways to fey creatures, though with key differences. While fey are truly linked to the flora and fauna of their homes, existing as the nearly immortal voices and guardians of the wilderness, elves are instead mortals who are in tune with the natural world around them. Elves seek to live in balance with the wild and understand it better than most other mortals. Some of this understanding is mystical, but an equal part comes from the elves' long lifespans, which in turn gives them long-ranging outlooks. Elves can expect to remain active in the same locale for centuries. By necessity, they must learn to maintain sustainable lifestyles, and this is most easily done when they work with nature, rather than attempting to bend it to their will.

## Age
Elves grow and age comparably to humans, up to the age of 12. After this point their mental development continues similarly to human children, but their physical development progresses only half as fast. The majority of elven puberty is complete at the age of 24. In most elven societies, children leave their parents to forge their own path around the age of 30. However, they are not considered ‘of age’ until the return around the age of 100. Elves start families when they are anywhere between 100 and 500 years of age. They are considered middle aged from the age of 500, but this has very little meaning as they remain as youthful as they were at 100. Elder elves are over 700 and their most venerable are over 900. Only the most long-lived elves see an entire millennium.

## Appearance
Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender physique that is accentuated by their long, pointed ears. However, it would be a mistake to consider them feeble or weak, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising power. Elves' colouration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze and almost bluish-white. Elves have little facial and no body hair.

## Features
Your elf character has a variety of natural features, which are the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

### Attribute Score Increase
Your Dexterity score rises by 2.

### Fey Ancestry
You are immune to magic sleep effects and have +1d to your defences to avoid being charmed.

### Keen Senses
You have +1d to Perception.

### Low-Light Vision
You can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light.

### Trance
Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

## Phenotype
Ancient divides amongst the elven people resulted in six main phenotypes: high elves, wood elves, sea elves, dark elves, shadow elves and fey elves. Choose one of these phenotypes.

### Dark Elf
Dark elves have skin that resembles charcoal or obsidian, as well as stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.

Dark elf adventurers are rare. Check with your Game Master to see if you can play one.

#### Infravision
Accustomed to darkness, you benefit from [infravision](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Special/#infravision).

#### Sunlight Sensitivity
You have -1d on attack rolls and on Perception checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

### Fey Elf
Fey elves are elves native to the Hedge, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion and boundless magic. A fey elf is associated with one of the four seasons and has colouration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the fey elf’s mood:
* Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter’s sorrow passes.
* Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.
* Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer’s harvest is shared with all.
* Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.

Some fey elves remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other fey elves transform, adopting characteristics of a new season. When finishing a long rest, any fey elf can change their season. A fey elf might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the fey elf’s current emotional state. For example, a fey elf might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another fey elf could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become a fey elf of spring and fury might cause a fey elf to change to summer.

### High Elf
Many high elves are haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to other species and races. They are fair of face with alabaster skin, light blonde, light brown, or jet black hair and blue or green eyes.

### Sea Elf
Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the world. While other elves traveled from realm to realm, the sea elves navigated the deepest currents and explored the waters. Today, they live in small, hidden communities in the ocean shallows.

#### Child of the Sea
You have a swimming speed equal to your base walking speed and you can breathe air and water.

### Shadow Elf
Sworn to the Raven Queen’s service, the mysterious shadow elves venture into the material plane from the shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and now they exist in a strange state between life and death. Fey elves and shadow elves are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.

### Wood Elf
Wood elves are frequently more friendly than high elves, with olive skin, dark brown, red, or ocasionally dark blonde hair and green, brown, or hazel eyes.

## Size
Elves range from well over 5 feet to around 6½ feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
