You have [darkvision](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Special/#darkvision). Additionally, [scent] is an [imprecise sense](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Senses/#imprecise-senses) for you with a range of 30 feet.

### Prehensile Tail
Your tail is especially flexible and strong, so youâ€™ve learned to use it for both movement and simple tricks.
