# Choosing a Species
Humans are the most common people in the world, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.

Not every intelligent species of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the most common species to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings are less common as adventurers. Dark elves, a race of elves, are also uncommon.

Your choice of species affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.

Your character's species not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story. Each species' description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that species, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their species. It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s background and personality.

## Species Traits
The description of each species includes species traits that are common to members of that species.

(Species armour proficiencies stack with class armour proficiencies to reduce the time to don and doff armour of that kind by one weight category.)

The following entries appear among the traits of most species:

### Ability Score Increase
Every species increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.

### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species' expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

### Alignment
Most species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

### Size
Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding unwieldy weapons, as explained in chapter 5.

### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (see Chapter 8) and fighting (see Chapter 9).

### Languages
By virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most common languages. A free choice of language is worth 1 character point.

### Races
Some species have races. Members of a race have the traits of the parent species in addition to the traits specified for their race. Relationships among races vary significantly from species to species and world to world.
