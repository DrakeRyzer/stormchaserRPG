# Goblinoids

## Coming Soon
* **Bugbears** are great, hairy goblinoids that stalk silently through the shadows, relying on stealth to attack.
* **Goblins** are short, ugly humanoids with scrawny bodies topped with oversized heads and massive ears.
* **Hobgoblins** are burly and muscled with dark orange skin, long arms, thick torsos and relatively short legs.
