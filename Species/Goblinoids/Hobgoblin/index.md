# Hobgoblin
War is the lifeblood of hobgoblins. Its glories are the dreams that inspire them. Its horrors don't feature in their nightmares. Cowardice is more terrible to hobgoblins than dying, for they carry their living acts into the afterlife. A hero in death becomes a hero eternal. 

## Age
Hobgoblins mature at the same rate as humans and have lifespans similar in length to theirs.

## Features

### Attribute Score Increase
Your Constitution or Dexterity score rises by 2.

### Fey Ancestry
You are immune to magic sleep effects and have +1d to your defences to avoid being charmed.

### Low-Light Vision
You can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light.

### Fey Gift
You can use this trait to take the Aid action on your turn as a free action, and you can do so a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. You may only do so once per turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
When you use the Aid action in this way, choose one of the options below on a success:
* **Hospitality.** You and the creature you aid each gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus your Constitution modifier.
* **Passage.** You and the creature you aid each increase your walking speeds by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
* **Spite.** Until the start of your next turn, the first time the creature you help hits a target with an attack roll, that target gains -1d on the next attack roll it makes within the next minute.

## Size
Hobgoblins are usually between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.
