# Changling
Neither here nor there, betwixt the realms of fey and the material, exist a kind known as Changelings. Stories speak of both small fey babes swapped at birth with unsuspecting sapient species, their fey parent forcing their changing nature to display in infancy so as to be raised like a cuckoo by the unsuspecting. Others still tell of spies embedded into society, some for the benefit of others, mostly for their own amusement, reaching positions of high power by assassinating their targets and taking their shape, form, voice, and personality on. Some, in whispers, tell of an ecstatic people that change their face and presentation with as much ease as their mood shifts. The vein of truth between these are the capabilities of the beings known as Changelings.
