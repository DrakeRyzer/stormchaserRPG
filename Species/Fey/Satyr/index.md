# Satyr
Satyrs have a well-earned reputation for their good spirits, gregarious personalities, and love of revels. Most satyrs are driven by simple desires, to see the world and to sample its every pleasure. While their spontaneity and whimsy sometimes put them at odds with more stoic peoples, satyrs rarely let the moodiness of others hinder their own happiness. Life is a blessing from the gods, after all, and the proper response to such a gift, as far as most satyrs are concerned, is to accept it with relish.

## Age
Satyrs mature and age at about the same rate as dwarves.

## Appearance
From the waist up, a satyr's torso resembles that of a muscular and attractive humanoid. A set of curled ram or goat horns emerge from their handsome, human-like head. However, from the waist down their legs appear more like those of a furry goat, complete with cloven hooves

## Features

### Attribute Score Increase
Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

### Ram
You can use your head and horns to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier in bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

### Mirthful Leaps
Whenever you take the [Leap](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Leap/) action, you can roll a d8 and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. 

### Cunning Linguist
You can weave fey magic into your words and music. As an action made while speaking or playing an instrument, you can cause one of the following tiny, harmless magical effects to manifest. Each effect persists for 1 round unless otherwise specified:
* You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within 10 feet of you.
* Your voice or music booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.
* You create a series of harmless colourful lights that move in a pattern of your choosing in a space you can see within 10 feet of you.
* You create an instantaneous sensory effect, such as a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or a faint odor of your choosing. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube within 10 feet of you.

### Fey Resistance
You have resistance to physical damage that isn't from cold iron weapons.

## Size
Satyrs range from just under 5 feet to about 6 feet in height, with generally slender builds. Your size is medium.
