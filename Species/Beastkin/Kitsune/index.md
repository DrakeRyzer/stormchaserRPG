# Kitsune
Kitsune, or fox folk, are vulpine shapeshifters known for their love of both trickery and art. Kitsune possess three forms: that of an attractive human of slender build with salient eyes, that of an ordinary fox and their true form of an anthropomorphic fox. Despite an irrepressible penchant for deception, kitsune prize loyalty and make true companions. They delight in the arts, particularly riddles and storytelling, and settle in ancestral clans, taking their wisdom from both the living and spirits.

## Age
Kitsune reach adulthood in their mid-teens and generally live into their late 70's.

## Appearance
A kitsune has three forms — a single human form, a single fox form and its true form, that of a humanoid fox. In their human forms, kitsune tend toward quickness and lithe beauty. In all forms they possess golden, amber, or brilliant blue eyes. In their true forms, they are covered with a downy coat of auburn fur, although more exotic coloration is possible.

## Features

### Attribute Score Increase
Your Dexterity score rises by 2.

### Change Shape
You can assume the appearance of a specific single human form of the same gender. You always take this specific form when you use this ability. You cannot use your bite attack when in your human form and your speed is reduced by 5 feet. However, you gain +1d on [Deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) checks made to appear human. Changing shape is an action. This ability otherwise functions as [Alter Self](), except that you do not adjust your ability scores and can remain in this form indefinitely.

You can also take the form of a [fox](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Bestiary/Animals/Fox/) whose appearance is static and cannot be changed each time you assume this form. Your bite attack's damage is reduced to 1d3 points of damage on a hit, but you gain +1d on [Deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) checks made to appear as a fox. Changing from kitsune to fox shape is an action. This ability otherwise functions as [Beast Shape II](), and your attribute scores change accordingly.

### Low-Light Vision
You can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light.

### Keen Senses
You have +1d to Perception.

### Keen Scent
[Scent](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Special/#scent) is an [imprecise sense](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Senses/#imprecise-senses) for you with a range of 30 feet.
