# Halfling
The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.

Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.

## Age
A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.

## Lucky

## Brave

## Halfling Nimbleness
You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

## Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

## Race
The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and stout, are more like closely related families than true races. Choose one of these races.
