# Celestial
Beings with celestial lineage have a significant amount of good outsider blood in their ancestry. Such a heritage can lie dormant for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently ordinary parents.

See [the Arden campaign setting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/Arden/Species/Lineages/Celestial/) for more details on celestial lineage in the world of Arden.

## Features

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
Your character has the following features.

### Darkvision
Blessed with a radiant soul, your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Celestial Resistance
You have resistance to sacred damage.

### Healing Hands
As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Light Bearer
You know the light cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

## Phenotypes
Four celestial phenotypes exist: fallen, herald, protector and scourge. Choose one of them for your character.

### Fallen
Those touched by dark powers as a youth or who turn to evil in early adulthood can become one of the fallen: a group of whose inner light has been replaced by shadow.

### Herald
Heralds are descended from messenger angels and other similar celestials. Their divine bloodline shows in their phenomenal quickness of body and mind.

### Protector
Protectors are charged by the powers of good to guard the weak, to strike at evil wherever it arises, and to stand vigilant against the darkness. From a young age, a protector aasimar receives advice and directives that urge to stand against evil.

### Scourge
The scourge are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil; a desire that is, at its best, unflinching and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourges wear masks to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle.
