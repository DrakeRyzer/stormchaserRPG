# Lineages
Your lineage describes an influence in your bloodline beyond your species alone. All of these options are unusual, but the most common of them are the result of an extraplanar and/or elemental ancestor.

If you wish for your character to benefit from a lineage's mechanical features, then you must purchase them at the price listed on the lineage's page. Alternatively, if your character has only inherited the visual aspects of their lineage, then you may do so without investing additional character points.

Typically, these choices are made when you create your character. If you wish for your character to manifest the signs of a special lineage as a part of your character's advancement, then discuss this with your GM in advance.
