# Aasimar
Aasimar are beings with a significant amount of celestial or other good outsider blood in their ancestry. Aasimar heritage can lie dormant for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently ordinary parents.

## Alignment
While not always benevolent, aasimar are more inclined toward acts of kindness rather than evil. They gravitate toward faiths or organisations associated with celestials. Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens, though it must be acknowledged that some aasimar take advantage of the reputation of their kind, brutally subverting the expectations of others with acts of terrifying cruelty or abject venality. "It’s always the one you least suspect" is the axiom these evil aasimars live by. They often lead double lives as upstanding citizens or false heroes, keeping their corruption well hidden. Thankfully, these few are the exception and not the rule.

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points

### Darkvision
Blessed with a radiant soul, your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Celestial Resistance
You have resistance to sacred damage.

### Healing Hands
As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Light Bearer
You know the light cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

## Phenotypes
Four phenotypes of aasimar exist: protector aasimar, scourge aasimar, fallen aasimar and herald aasimar. Choose one of them for your character.

### Fallen Aasimar
An aasimar who was touched by dark powers as a youth or who turns to evil in early adulthood can become one of the fallen: a group of aasimar whose inner light has been replaced by shadow.

### Herald Aasimar

### Protector Aasimar
Protector aasimar are charged by the powers of good to guard the weak, to strike at evil wherever it arises, and to stand vigilant against the darkness. From a young age, a protector aasimar receives advice and directives that urge to stand against evil.

### Scourge Aasimar
Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil; a desire that is, at its best, unflinching and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourge aasimar wear masks to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle.

## Size
Characters with aasimar lineage are slightly taller than others of their species.
