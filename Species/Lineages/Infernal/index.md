# Infernal
Simultaneously more and less than mortal, those with infernal lineage are the offspring of fiends. With otherworldly blood and traits to match, they are often shunned and despised out of reactionary fear. Most never know their fiendish sire, as the coupling that produced their curse occurred generations earlier. The taint is long-lasting and persistent, often manifesting at birth or sometimes later in life, as a powerful, though often unwanted, boon.

See [the Arden campaign setting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/Arden/Species/Lineages/Infernal/) for more details on infernal lineage in the world of Arden.
