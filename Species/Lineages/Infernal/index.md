# Infernal
Simultaneously more and less than mortal, those with infernal lineage are the offspring of fiends. With otherworldly blood and traits to match, they are often shunned and despised out of reactionary fear. Most never know their fiendish sire, as the coupling that produced their curse occurred generations earlier. The taint is long-lasting and persistent, often manifesting at birth or sometimes later in life, as a powerful, though often unwanted, boon.

See [the Arden campaign setting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/Arden/Species/Lineages/Infernal/) for more details on infernal lineage in the world of Arden.

## Features

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points
Those with infernal lineage share certain features as a result of their fiendish descent.

### Low-Light Vision
*Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.*

You can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light.

If your species already grants you [low-light vision](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Species/Common/Elf/#low-light-vision), you instead gain [infravision](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Special/#infravision).

### Hellish Resistance
You have resistance to fire damage.

### Infernal Legacy
You know the [Thaumaturgy](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Transmutation/#thaumaturgy) cantrip and the [Hellish Rebuke](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Evocation/#hellish-rebuke) spell. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
