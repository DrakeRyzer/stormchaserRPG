# Dark Elf
Dark elves have skin that resembles charcoal or obsidian, as well as stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.

Drow adventurers are rare. Check with your Game Master to see if you can play one.

## Darkvision
Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You canâ€™t discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Sunlight Sensitivity
You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

## Dark Elf Magic
You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

## Dark Elf Weapon Training
You are proficient with martial blades and simple crossbows. You treat any weapon with the word "elven" in its name or properties as a martial weapon. If your class grants proficiency with martial blades **or** simple crossbows, you gain 1 proficiency point. If your class grants proficiency with **both** martial blades **and** simple crossbows, you gain 2 proficiency points.
