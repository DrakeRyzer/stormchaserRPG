# Wood Elf
As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. Wood elves are frequently more friendly than high elves, with olive skin, dark brown, red, or ocasionally dark blonde hair and green, brown, or hazel eyes.

## Fleet of Foot
Add 5 feet to your base walking speed.
