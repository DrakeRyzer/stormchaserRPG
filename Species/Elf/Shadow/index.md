# Shadow Elf
Sworn to the Raven Queen’s service, the mysterious shadow elves venture into the material plane from the shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and now they exist in a strange state between life and death. Fey elves and shadow elves are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.

## Necrotic Resistance
You have resistance to necrotic damage.

## Blessing of the Raven Queen
As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.
