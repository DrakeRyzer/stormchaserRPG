# Elf
Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry and the good things of the world.

Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

## Age
Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

## Features

## Attribute Score Increase
Your Dexterity score rises by 2.

### Low-Light Vision
Elves can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.

### Keen Senses
You have +1d in the Perception skill.

### Fey Ancestry
You have +1d to your defences to avoid being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

### Trance
Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

## Phenotype
Ancient divides amongst the elven people resulted in six main phenotypes: high elves, wood elves, sea elves, dark elves, shadow elves and fey elves. Choose one of these phenotypes.

### Dark Elf
Dark elves have skin that resembles charcoal or obsidian, as well as stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.

Dark elf adventurers are rare. Check with your Game Master to see if you can play one.

#### Darkvision
Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Sunlight Sensitivity
You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Perception checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

### Fey Elf
Fey elves are elves native to the Hedge, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion and boundless magic. A fey elf is associated with one of the four seasons and has colouration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the fey elf’s mood:
* Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter’s sorrow passes.
* Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.
* Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer’s harvest is shared with all.
* Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.

Some fey elves remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other fey elves transform, adopting characteristics of a new season. When finishing a long rest, any fey elf can change their season. A fey elf might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the fey elf’s current emotional state. For example, a fey elf might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another fey elf could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become a fey elf of spring and fury might cause a fey elf to change to summer.

### High Elf
Many high elves are haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to other species and races. They are fair of face with alabaster skin, light blonde, light brown, or jet black hair and blue or green eyes.

### Sea Elf
Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the world. While other elves traveled from realm to realm, the sea elves navigated the deepest currents and explored the waters. Today, they live in small, hidden communities in the ocean shallows.

#### Child of the Sea
You have a swimming speed equal to your base walking speed and you can breathe air and water.

### Shadow Elf
Sworn to the Raven Queen’s service, the mysterious shadow elves venture into the material plane from the shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and now they exist in a strange state between life and death. Fey elves and shadow elves are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.

### Wood Elf
Wood elves are frequently more friendly than high elves, with olive skin, dark brown, red, or ocasionally dark blonde hair and green, brown, or hazel eyes.

## Size
Elves range from well over 5 feet to around 6½ feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

## Speed
Add 5 feet to your base walking speed.
