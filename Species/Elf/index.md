# Elf
Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry and the good things of the world.

Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

## Ability Score Increase
Your Dexterity score rises by 2.

## Age
Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

## Size
Elves range from well over 5 feet to around 6½ feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

## Features

### Low-Light Vision
Elves can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.

### Keen Senses
You have +1d in the Perception skill.

### Fey Ancestry
You have +1d to your defences to avoid being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

### Trance
Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

## Race
Ancient divides amongst the elven people resulted in six main races: high elves, wood elves, sea elves, dark elves, shadow elves and fey elves. Choose one of these races.
