# Giantkin
At the highest mountain peaks, far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl, dwell the reclusive giantkin. Few folk can claim to have seen a giantkin and fewer still can claim friendship with one. Giantkin wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each giantkin with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.

Giantkin share a number of traits in common with each other.

## Ability Score Increase
Your choice of your Strength score, or your Constitution score increases by 2.

## Age
Giantkin have life spans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.

## Size
Giantkin stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium.

## Natural Athlete
You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.

## Stone’s Endurance
You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. On your turn, if you took damage in the last round, you can roll a d12 as a free action. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and recover an amount of stamina equal to that total. If damage reduces you to 0 stamina, then this ability is automatically used, even if it isn't your turn. After you use Stone's Endurance, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Powerful Build
You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

You have resistance to cold damage. You’re also acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet.

You can speak, read, and write Common and Giant.

## Description

### Driven Competitors
Every day brings a new challenge to the giantkin. Food, water, and shelter are rare in the uppermost mountain reaches. A single mistake can bring doom to an entire tribe, while an individual’s heroic effort can ensure the entire group’s survival.

Giantkin thus place a premium on self-sufficiency and individual skill. They have a compulsion to keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Giantkin love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills.

This dedication to competition has a dark side. Giantkin are ferocious competitors, but above all else they are driven to outdo their past efforts. If a giantkin slays a dragon, he or she might seek out a larger, more powerful wyrm to battle. Few giantkin adventurers reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past accomplishments.

### Fair Play
For giantkin, competition exists only when it is supported by a level playing field. Competition measures talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic items, money, or other elements that can tip the balance one way or the other. Giantkin happily rely on such benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an advantage can always be lost. A giantkin who relies too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains.

This trait manifests most strongly when giantkin interact with other folk. The relationship between peasants and nobles puzzles giantkin. If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place. Giantkin rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society’s structures or rules to maintain power.

### Survival of the Fittest
Among giantkin, any adult who can’t contribute to the tribe is expelled. A lone giantkin has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Giantkin have little pity for adults who can’t take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the giantkin concept of fair play.

A permanently injured giantkin is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe. Typically, such a giantkin dies attempting to keep up, or the giantkin slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate.

In some ways, the giantkin drive to outdo themselves feeds into the grim inevitability of their decline and death. A giantkin would much rather die in battle, at the peak of strength and skill, than endure the slow decay of old age. Few folk have ever meet an elderly giantkin, and even those giantkin who have left their people grapple with the urge to give up their lives as their physical skills decay.

Because of their risk-taking, giantkin tribes suffer from a chronic lack of the experience offered by long-term leaders. They hope for innate wisdom in their leadership, for they can rarely count on a wisdom grown with age.

### Giantkin Names
Every giantkin has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn’s mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. A birth name is up to three syllables long. Clan names are five syllables or more and end in a vowel.

Birth names are rarely linked to gender. Giantkin see females and males as equal in all things, and they find societies with roles divided by gender to be puzzling or worthy of mockery. To a giantkin, the person who is best at a job should be the one tasked with doing it.

A giantkin’s nickname is a description that can change on the whim of a chieftain or tribal elder. It refers to a notable deed, either a success or failure, committed by the giantkin. Giantkin assign and use nicknames with their friends of other races, and change them to refer to an individual’s notable deeds.

Giantkin present all three names when identifying themselves, in the order of birth name, nickname, and clan name. In casual conversation, they use their nickname.
