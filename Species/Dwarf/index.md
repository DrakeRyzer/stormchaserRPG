# Dwarf
Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs. These are common to all dwarves.

Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

## Ability Score Increase
Your Constitution score rises by 2.

## Age
Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, up to the age of 12. After this point their mental development continues similarly to human children, but their physical development progresses only half as fast. The majority of dwarven puberty is complete at the age of 24 and they are considered ‘of age’ at 30. Although dwarves are capable of reproduction from around the age of 20, they typically start families between the age of 150 and 250. At the age of 250 a dwarf is considered middle-aged and elder dwarves are over 350 years old. The truly venerable live to be 450 or older. Very few dwarves live past 500.

## Alignment
Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.

## Size
Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

## Speed
Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is never reduced by wearing armour.

## Darkvision
Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Dwarven Resilience
Poison attack rolls have disadvantage to hit you. You have advantage on defence checks against poison and you have ]resistance](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/DamageResistanceandVulnerability/) against [poison damage](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/DamageRolls/#poison).

## Dwarven Combat Training
You are proficient with simple axes and simple bludgeoning weapons. If your class grants proficiency with simple axes or simple bludgeoning weapons, you gain proficiency in martial axes or martial bludgeoning weapons, respectively. You treat any weapon with the word "dwarven" in its name or properties as a martial weapon. If your class grants proficiency with martial axes **or** martial bludgeoning weapons, you gain 1 proficiency point. If your class grants proficiency with **both** martial axes **and** martial bludgeoning weapons, you gain 2 proficiency points.

## Tool Proficiency
You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.

## Stonecunning
Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered to have expertise in the History skill.

## Languages
You can speak, read, and write Dwarven and one local human language of your choice. Dwarven is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

## Race
Two main races of dwarves populate the world: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves. Choose one of these races.
