# Dwarf
Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs. These are common to all dwarves.

Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

## Ability Score Increase
Your Constitution score rises by 2.

## Age
Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, up to the age of 12. After this point their mental development continues similarly to human children, but their physical development progresses only half as fast. The majority of dwarven puberty is complete at the age of 24 and they are considered ‘of age’ at 30. Although dwarves are capable of reproduction from around the age of 20, they typically start families between the age of 150 and 250. At the age of 250 a dwarf is considered middle-aged and elder dwarves are over 350 years old. The truly venerable live to be 450 or older. Very few dwarves live past 500.

## Size
Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

## Speed
Subtract 5 feet from your base walking speed. However, your speed is never modified by armour or encumbrance.

## Darkvision
Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Dwarven Resilience
You have +1d to your defences vs poison and [resistance](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/DamageResistanceandVulnerability/) to [poison damage](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/DamageRolls/#poison).
