# Dwarf
Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel the depredations of invaders, such as orcs and goblins. More than any other race, dwarves have acquired a reputation as dour and humourless artisans of the earth. It could be said that their history shapes the dark disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at war with giants, goblins and other such horrors.

## Age
Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, up to the age of 12. After this point their mental development continues similarly to human children, but their physical development progresses only half as fast. The majority of dwarven puberty is complete at the age of 24 and they are considered ‘of age’ at 30. Although dwarves are capable of reproduction from around the age of 20, they typically start families between the age of 150 and 250. At the age of 250 a dwarf is considered middle-aged and elder dwarves are over 350 years old. The truly venerable live to be 450 or older. Very few dwarves live past 500.

Dwarves move Charisma to the set of attributes receiving penalties with age and Constitution to those receiving bonuses.
