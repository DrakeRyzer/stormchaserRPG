# Species
In this section, you will find the species that you can choose from when building your character. Your character’s species determines their physical appearance, as well as other physical aspects like size and speed. These features all stem from your character's *biology*.

The following entries appear for most species:

## Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species' expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character.

Advanced age modifies your attribute scores. Age brackets vary with species. These effects are described individually and are not cumulative.

| Age Bracket | Effects |
|:-----------:|:-------:|
| Middle Age | -1 to Str, Dex or Con. +1 to Int, Wis or Cha. |
| Elderly    | -1 to two of Str, Dex and Con. +1 to two of Int, Wis and Cha.<br>Movement speed is reduced by 5 ft. |
| Venerable  | -1 to Str, Dex and Con. +1 to Int, Wis and Cha.<br>Movement speed is reduced by 5 ft. |

## Alignment
A few specific species, such as dragonkin, originate from bloodlines that have strong inclinations towards specific alignments. These are not binding for player characters, who may overcome their nature through great effort. However, this can lend a certain flavour to a character's story.

## Appearance
A brief description of the typical appearance of a member of the species.

## Features
The description of each species includes features that are common to members of that species.

### Attribute Score Increase
Every species increases one or more of a character's physical attribute scores.

## Phenotype
Some species can be classified into distinct phenotypical groupings. Members of a given phenotype have all of the features of their species, along with some specific to their phenotype. Relationships among phenotypical groups vary significantly.

## Size
This tells you the physical size of members of the species. Medium corresponds roughly to the height and weight range of a human adult, and Small is roughly half of that.

To randomly determine a character's height, roll the modifier dice indicated on the table below and add the result, in inches, to the base height for your character's race and gender. To determine a character's weight, multiply the result of the modifier dice by the weight multiplier and add the result to the base weight for your character’s race and gender.

Alternatively, you can choose your character’s height and weight based on the information provided in the table.

## Speed
Each time that a creature spends an action (such as [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Stride/)) to move, they move their speed.

All creatures have a base speed of:

<center><strong>Speed in Feet = ( Strength Score + Dexterity Score )</strong></center>

This entry modifies a creature's base speed, depending on it species.
