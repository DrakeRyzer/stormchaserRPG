# Species
A visit to one of the great cities in the world overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.

The people themselves are of varying size, shape, and colour, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues. Many different species are represented, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.

Scattered among the members of these more common species are the true exotics. A hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging to the species of either of their parents, and there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone dark elf trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind.
