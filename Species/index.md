# Species
In this section, you will find the species that you can choose from when building your character. Your character’s species determines their physical appearance, as well as other physical aspects like size and speed. These features all stem from your character's *biology*.

The following entries appear for most species:

## Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species' expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

## Attribute Score Increase
Every species increases one or more of a character’s attribute scores.

## Species Features
The description of each species includes species traits that are common to members of that species.

(Species armour proficiencies stack with class armour proficiencies to reduce the time to don and doff armour of that kind by one weight category.)

## Size
Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding [unwieldy weapons](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Weapons/WeaponTableGlossary/#unwieldy).

## Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when [traveling](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/Movement/) and [fighting](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/MovementandPosition/).

## Races
Some species have races. Members of a race have the traits of the parent species in addition to the traits specified for their race. Relationships among races vary significantly from species to species and world to world.
