# Advancement
As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, they gain experience. Eventually, this leads to advancements in capability by gaining and spending character points, which can be used to purchase new abilities. Characters advance based on when they accomplish significant story goals in the campaign. The GM tells the players when their characters gain character points, which may be spent in the following ways:

###### Character Point Costs

| Benefit | Cost |
|:-------:|:----:|
| Talent | 12 |
| Feat | 8 |
| Weapon Mastery | 4 |
| Skill Mastery | 4 |
| Increase an Ability Score by 1 | 4 |
| Weapon Expertise | 3 |
| Skill Expertise | 3 |
| Tool Mastery | 3 |
| Weapon Proficiency | 2 |
| Skill Proficiency | 2 |
| Tool Expertise | 2 |
| Cantrip | 2 |
| Subskill | 1 |
| Tool Proficiency | 1 |
| Language Proficiency | 1 |

* You canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20.
* Expertise requires proficiency. Mastery requires expertise.
* When you permanently increase your Intelligence modifier or your proficiency modifier, you may spend additional points as normal. Proficiencies learned by spending points cannot be lost once gained.

## Talents, Stamina and Stamina Dice
Each time you gain a talent, you gain 1 additional Stamina Die.

Character points can be spent to increase your ability scores. However, 

When your Constitution score increases, your stamina maximum also increases. Multiply your new Constitution score by your class multiplier to calculate your new stamina maximum. For example, if your 7th-level warrior has a Constitution score of 17 and increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18 when he reaches 8th level, then his stamina maximum then increases by 4 from 68 to 72.

## Starting Wealth
The Starting Wealth table lists the amount of treasure that each PC is expected to have at a specific number of talents, in addition to their starting equipment from background and class.

Note that this table assumes a standard fantasy game. Low-fantasy games might award only half this value, while high-fantasy games might double the value. It is assumed that some of this treasure is consumed in the course of an adventure (such as potions and scrolls) and that some of the less useful items are sold for half value so more useful gear can be purchased.
