# Magic Talents

#### Characters with Arcane and Divine Spellcasting
If you have both Arcane and Divine spellcasting, you only receive the mana pool of your highest spell level. You still receive all prepared spells from each spellcasting talent, and you can obtain bonus spells for each spellcasting talent from any one branch or tree which you have talents already.

For example, suppose a character has Level 1 Arcane Spellcasting and Level 1 Divine Spellcasting, and they use the same spellcasting attribute which has been raised to 18 (modifier of +4). They would have the following available to them:

- 4 Arcane cantrips plus 4 Divine cantrips
- 4 Arcane spells known plus 2 bonus spells from any one branch/tree which the character has talents
- 4 levels of Divine spells prepared plus 2 bonus spells from any one branch/tree which the character has talents
- Mana Pool of 3

If the character were to increase either Divine or Arcane spellcasting, they would gain the additional spells known or prepared as well as the increased mana pool from 3 to 6.
