# Magic Talents

## Magic Initiateᴮᴳ
Choose a class: bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. You learn two cantrips of your choice from that class’s spell list.

In addition, choose one 1st-level spell to learn from that same list. Using this feat, you can cast the spell once at its lowest level, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again.

Your spellcasting ability for these spells depends on the class you chose: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.

## Meta-Magician
*Prerequisite: Wizard*<br>
As a wizard’s knowledge of magic grows, he can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the norm. Casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal and spells modified by metamagic are cast at a higher level than normal.

In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast at a higher spell level. The modifications made only apply to spells cast directly by the wizard. A wizard can’t use metamagic to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device. A wizard can apply multiple metamagic effects to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can’t apply the same metamagic effect more than once to a single spell.

**Careful Spell.** *+1 Spell Level*<br>
When you cast a spell that targets other creatures' defences, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. Choose a number of those creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature is automatically missed by the spell.

**Distant Spell.** *+1 Spell Level*<br>
When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can make the range of the spell 30 feet.

**Empowered Spell.** *+1 Spell Level*<br>
When you roll damage for a spell, you can reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

**Extended Spell.** *+1 Spell Level*<br>
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

**Heightened Spell** *+3 Spell Levels*<br>
When you cast a spell that targets a creature's defence, you have advantage to hit.

**Quickened Spell** *+2 Spell Levels*<br>
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

**Subtle Spell.** *+1 Spell Level*<br>
When you cast a spell, you can cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

**Twinned Spell.** *Double Spell Level*<br>
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can target a second creature in range with the same spell.

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren't eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.

## Twin Secrets
You can concentrate on two spells simultaneously without incurring exhaustion. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on two spells, the attacker rolls with a bonus of the sum of the levels of both spells, or half the damage that you took, whichever number is higher, vs your spellcasting attribute's defence to break your concentration. Alternatively, you can choose to stop concentrating on one spell, to retain concentration on the other.

## War Caster
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast spells_<br>
You've practiced casting powers in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
* Attempts to break your concentration on a spell when you take damage suffer disadvantage.
* You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.
* On your turn, you may declare that, for the next round, when a hostile creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you will cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.

## Well of Powerᴮᴳ
A deep wellspring of magical power resides within you.
* Increase your mana by one per short rest, or by three per long rest.
