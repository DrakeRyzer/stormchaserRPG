# Paladin Talent Tree
Through a select, worthy few shines the power of the divine. Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and lives to the battle against evil. Knights, crusaders, and law-bringers, paladins seek not just to spread divine justice but to embody the teachings of the virtuous deities they serve. In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline. As reward for their righteousness, these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.

**As long as at least half of your disciple talents are from the paladin talent tree, your stamina increases to 4× your Constitution score and your recovery die increases to a d10.**

### Divine Sense
You can use *detect evil*, as the spell, at will. As an action, you concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is evil. Additionally, studying the target for 3 rounds determines the strength of its aura. While focusing on one individual or object, the paladin does not detect evil in any other object or individual within range.

### Lay on Hands 
Your blessed touch can revitalise and heal. You always have the [*cure wounds*](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Level1/Evocation/#cure-wounds) and [*lesser restoration*](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Level2/Abjuration/#lesser-restoration) spells prepared and they do not count against your number of spells prepared. You can cast these spells on yourself as a bonus action.

### Divine Health
*Prerequisite:* Lay on Hands<br>
Divine magic flowing through you and makes you immune to disease.

### Divine Smite
*Prerequisite:* Divine Sense<br>
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend mana to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d8 per point of mana expended. The maximum amount of mana that you can spend is equal to the highest level of spells that you can cast. The damage increases by an additional 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

### Extra Attack 
*Prerequisite:* Divine Smite<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Aura of Protection
*Prerequisite:* 2nd Level Spells and 3 Other Paladin Talents<br>
Whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

### Aura of Courage
*Prerequisite:* 3rd Level Spells, Aura of Protection and 5 Other Paladin Talents<br>
You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.

### Greater Divine Smite
*Prerequisite:* 3rd Level Spells, Divine Smite and 6 Other Paladin Talents<br>
You are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

### Cleansing Touch
*Prerequisite:* 4th Level Spells and 8 Other Paladin Talents<br>
You can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Greater Auras
*Prerequisite:* 5th Level Spells and 10 Other Paladin Talents<br>
The range of your auras increase to 30 feet.

### Paragon
*Prerequisite:* 5th Level Spells and 11 Other Paladin Talents<br>
