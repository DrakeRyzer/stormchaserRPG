# Paladin Talent Tree
Through a select, worthy few shines the power of the divine. Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and lives to the battle against evil. Knights, crusaders, and law-bringers, paladins seek not just to spread divine justice but to embody the teachings of the virtuous deities they serve. In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline. As reward for their righteousness, these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.

**As long as at least half of your disciple talents are from the paladin talent tree, your stamina increases to 4× your Constitution score and your recovery die increases to a d10.**

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 1 action
You can use [Detect Evil](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Level1/Divination/#detect-evil), as the spell, at will. You concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is evil. Additionally, studying the target for 3 rounds determines the strength of its aura. While focusing on one individual or object, the paladin does not detect evil in any other object or individual within range.
