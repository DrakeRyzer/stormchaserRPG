# Spores
Spore druids find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life.

These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn’t the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.

Spore Druids have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
You learn the *Chill Touch* cantrip. If you already know that cantrip you may learn another cantrip of your choice from the disciple spell list. Additionally, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Halo of Spores

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. As a free action at the beginning of your turn, you can make an indirect spell attack versus the Constitution defense of a creature that is within 10 feet of you or a creature that entered within 10 feet of you during the last round. On a hit, the target take 1d4 necrotic damage.

### Symbiotic Entity

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Halo of Spores
You gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a number mana to awaken those spores. You gain 1d4 + 4 temporary stamina for the 1st mana spent and 5 additional temporary stamina for each mana spent 1st; the maximum amount of mana that you may spend on a single casting is equal to the maximum level of spells that you can cast. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:
* Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.
* When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
	
These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape.

### Fungal Infestation

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Symbiotic Entity
Your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use a free action to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the *zombie* stat block in the beastiary. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies. In combat, the zombie’s turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting modifier, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

Additionally, your Halo of Spores damage die increases to 1d6.

### Spreading Spores

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Fungal Infestation
You gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer active.

As a free action, at the beginning of your turn you must make an indirect spell attack against the Constitution defense of all creatures that moved into the area of these spores on their last turn. If an attack hits, the creature takes damage equal to your Halo of Spores damage.

While the cube of spores persists, creatures do not take damage from your Halo of Spores.

Additionally, your Halo of Spores damage die increases to 1d8.

### Fungal Body

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Spreading Spores
The fungal spores in your body alter you: you can’t be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead, unless you’re incapacitated.

Additionally, your Halo of Spores damage die increases to 1d10.
