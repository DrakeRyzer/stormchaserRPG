# Stargazer
Instead of focusing their attention on the land and animals around them, Stargazers study the heavenly bodies that move through the skies. These druids look to connect how the movement of the stars and the moon affects events on the lands below. They are often sought out by others to gain their insight as an oracle or soothsayer. 

Stargazers also like to keep records of their findings. However, their archives are typically more esoteric in nature - rock formations, runes and carvings that have been secreted away in caverns, underground libraries, or other locations to ensure that their knowledge is kept safe.
