# Stargazer
Instead of focusing their attention on the land and animals around them, Stargazers study the heavenly bodies that move through the skies. These druids look to connect how the movement of the stars and the moon affects events on the lands below. They are often sought out by others to gain their insight as an oracle or soothsayer. 

Stargazers also like to keep records of their findings. However, their archives are typically more esoteric in nature - rock formations, runes and carvings that have been secreted away in caverns, underground libraries, or other locations to ensure that their knowledge is kept safe.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
You gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
|:-----------:|:------:|
| 1st | *Comprehend Languages, Guiding Bolt* |   
| 2nd | *Augury, Enhance Ability* |  
| 3rd | *Remove Curse, Haste* |  
| 4th | *Divination, Guardian of Faith* |  
| 5th | *Legend Lore, Wall of Stone* |  

### Bonus Equipment
You have created map of your findings of the stars. Its form is determined by rolling on the table below, or by choosing one.

| d6 | Map Form |
|:--:|:---------|
| 1 | A scroll covered with depictions of constellations |   
| 2 | A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it |  
| 3 | A speckled owlbear hide, tooled with raised marks |  
| 4 | A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover |  
| 5 | A crystal that projects starry patterns when placed before a light |  
| 6 | Glass disks that depict constellations |  

Your map is a tiny object and can be used as a focus for casting your spells. If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest and destroys the previous map.

While holding the map, you have the following benefits:
* You know the *guidance* cantrip.
* You have a separate pool of mana that you can draw upon to cast *guiding bolt*. This pool is equal to your spellcasting modifier. A *guiding bolt* cast in this way can be upcast no higher than your usual maximum spell level. The pool is replinished when you finish a long rest.

### Summon the Stars

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You call down the stars to grant you their power. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 mana and choose which constellation you summon from the list below. A small representation of the starry formation floats near you in your space, but is neither a creature or an object. While it exists, the stars produce bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. 

The constellation lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), become incapacitated, die, use this talent again, or use your Wild Shape.

**The Chariot.** The brave warrior of The Chariot springs into action. As part of the bonus action when you first summon this constellation and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, launching a shard of a star, against one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier.

**The Empress.** The Empress brings you nurturing abundance when called. Whenever you cast a spell using mana that restores stamina to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain stamina equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier.

**The High Priestess.** The High Priestess desires to share her sacred knowledge and strength of mind. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10. Additionally, you gain bonus to your Constitution defense equal to you spellcasting modifier in attempts to break your concentration on a spell.

### Wheel of Fortune

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Summon the Stars
Whenever you finish a long rest you seek guidance from the stars for sings of what the next day may bring. When you do so, roll a die. You gain access to the below based on whether you rolled and even or odd number on the die:

**Boon (even).** As a free action on your turn you may grant a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you +1d to their next attack roll or ability check. 

**Doom (odd).** As a free action on your turn you may grant a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you -1d to their next attack roll or ability check. 

You can use this talent  a number of times equal to your spellcasting modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### The Magician

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Wheel of Fortune
The constellation of The Magician represents raw power and inspiration. He is called to assist the constellation chosen by your Summon the Stars talent.  The 1d8 of The Chariot and The Empress becomes 2d8, and while The High Priestess is active you have a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Additionally, at the start of your turn you may change the constellation from your Summon the Stars without the need to spend mana.

### The Moon

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and The Magician
Like an eclipse, The Moon passes between you and your attacker. While your Summon the Stars is active, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage.
