# Dreams
Dream druids hail from regions that have strong ties to the hedge and its dreamlike realms. The druids’ guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms that they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and the weary can find rest.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
You gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have a bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Balm of the Summer Court

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to two times the maximum spell level that you can cast.

As a bonus action, you can choose one creature that you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice up to one-half of the maximum of the dice pool. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains stamina equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary stamina per die spent.

You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Hearth of Moonglow and Shadow

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Balm of the Summer Court
Home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.

While within the sphere, you and your allies gain +1d to stealth and perception checks. Light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn’t visible outside it.

The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.

### Hidden Paths

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Hearth of Moonglow and Shadow
You can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature that you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Walker in Dreams

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Hidden Paths
The magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands. When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: *dream* (with you as the messenger), *scrying*, or *teleportation circle*.

This use of teleportation circle is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven’t taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn’t wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
