# Land
 
Land druids are typically mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.
 
## Branch Features
 

### Bonus Cantrip
 
You learn one additional cantrip from the divine spell list.

### Bonus Spells
 
When you choose this branch, select which terrain influences you the most: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, subterranean or swamp. You gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.
 
If you have a bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.
