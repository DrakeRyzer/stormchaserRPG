# Druid Talent Tree (Disciple)
Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilisation. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature’s wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilisation.

## Bonus Proficiencies
When you take your first druid talent, you learn Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, but can’t decipher it without magic.

## Spell School Proficiencies
If your first talent is a druid talent, then you are trained in the following spell schools: Abjuration, Charms, Conjuration, Divination, Evocation, Restoration and Transmutation.

### Wild Shape

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 2
You can expend 1 or more mana and magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.

The amount of mana expended determines the maximum CR of the beasts that you can transform into (as shown in the table below) and the maximum amount of mana that you may spend on a single wildshape is equal to the maximum level of spells that you can cast.

| Expended Mana | Maximum CR | Duration |
|:-------------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| 1 | 1/4 | 1 Hour |
| 2 | 1/2 | 2 Hours |
| 3 | 1/2 | 3 Hours |
| 4 | 1 | 4 Hours |
| 5 | 1 | 5 Hours |
| 6 | 1 | 6 Hours |
| 7 | 1 | 7 Hours |
| 8 | 2 | 8 Hours |
| 9 | 2 | 9 Hours |
| 10 | 2 | 10 Hours |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to the mana expended to take that form. You then revert to your normal form, unless you expend further mana. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and defence proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
* When you transform, you assume the beast’s stamina and recovery dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the amount of stamina that you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 stamina left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 stamina, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
* You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. However, transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell that you’ve already cast, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you’ve already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

### Wild Companion

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 1 Other Druid Talent<br>**Actions:** 2
You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form. You can cast the *find familiar* spell, without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to the spell level at which you cast the spell.

### Timeless Body

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:**9th Level Spells and 5 Other Druid Talents
The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

### Beast Spells

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:**9th Level Spells and 5 Other Druid Talents
You can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.

### Archdruid

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 100 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:**10th Level Spells and 6 Other Druid Talents
You are one with nature. Your spellcasting ability score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score also increases by 4.

Additionally, you can use your Wild Shape at 1st level an unlimited number of times, and you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.
