# Druid Talent Tree
Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilisation. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature’s wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilisation.

## Druidic
When you take your first druid talent, you gain access to the secret language of druids. You must spend points on proficiency in this language as normal. Once you speak druidic, you can use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Perception check, but can’t decipher it without magic.

### Wild Shape

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points
You learn the [Beast Shape](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Transmutation/#beast-shape) spell. You always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

You have a separate pool of mana that you can draw upon to cast this spell. This pool is equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier and is replenished when you finish a long rest.
### Wild Companion

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 2
You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form. You can cast the [find familiar](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Conjuration/#find-familiar) spell, without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to the spell level at which you cast the spell.

### Timeless Body

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 9th Level Spells and 120 Points in Druid Talents
The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

### Beast Spells

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 9th Level Spells and 120 Points in Druid Talents
You can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.

### Archdruid

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 100 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 10th Level Spells and 200 Points in Druid Talents
You are one with nature. Your spellcasting ability score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score also increases by 4.

Additionally, you can use your Wild Shape at 1st level an unlimited number of times, and you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.
