# Primal
Those druids that have learned the ways of primal druidism generally look to the beasts of the wild and the primordial elements for direction. Circle of the Primal druids are often found roaming their territory in the form of powerful animals, hunting and driving out trespassers. As their power grows, these druids call on the strength of the elements of earth, fire, water and wind to fuel their spells and ability to change shape.
