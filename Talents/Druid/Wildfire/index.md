# Wildfire
Wildfire druids understand that destruction is sometimes the precursor of creation, such as when a forest fire promotes later growth. These druids bond with a primal spirit that harbors both destructive and creative power, allowing the druids to create controlled flames that burn away one thing but give life to another.

### Summon Wildfire Spirit
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 1st Level Spells and Wild Shape

You can summon the primal spirit bound to your soul. As an action, you can expend mana to summon your wildfire spirit. The maximum amount of mana that you may spend at once is equal to the maximum level of spells that you can cast. 

The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. When it appears, you make an attack on each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) against their Dexterity defense. On a hit they take 2d6 fire damage.

The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. Statistics are provided for the spirit in the below stat block. You determine the spirit’s appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.

In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The spirit exists for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.


### Enhanced Bond
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Summon Wildfire Spirit

The bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your destructive and restorative spells. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage or restores hit points while your wildfire spirit is summoned, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus equal to the number rolled to one damage or healing roll of the spell.

In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your wildfire spirit.

### Cauterizing Flames
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Enhanced Bond

You gain the ability to turn death into magical flames that can heal or incinerate. When a small or larger creature dies within 30 feet of you or your wildfire spirit, a harmless spectral flame springs forth in the dead creature’s space and flickers there for 1 minute. 

As a free action at the beginning of your turn, you can extinguish the spectral flame there and either heal or deal fire damage to a creature that has passed through the flames on their last turn . The healing or damage equals 2d10 + your spellcasting modifier.

You can use this talent a number of times equal to your spellcasting modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Blazing Reival
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Cauterizing Flame

The bond with your wildfire spirit can save you from death. If the spirit is within 120 feet of you when you are reduced to 0 stamina and thereby fall unconscious, you can cause the spirit to drop to 0 hit points. You then regain half your stamina and immediately rise to your feet.

Once you use this talent, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
