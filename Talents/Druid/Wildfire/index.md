# Wildfire
Wildfire druids understand that destruction is sometimes the precursor of creation, such as when a forest fire promotes later growth. These druids bond with a primal spirit that harbors both destructive and creative power, allowing the druids to create controlled flames that burn away one thing but give life to another.

In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It takes the Dodge action on its turn unless you take use 1 action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The spirit exists for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 stamina, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.

### Enhanced Bond

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Summon Wildfire Spirit
The bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your destructive and restorative spells. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage or restores hit points while your wildfire spirit is summoned, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus equal to the number rolled to one damage or healing roll of the spell.

In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your wildfire spirit.

### Cauterising Flames

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Enhanced Bond
You gain the ability to turn death into magical flames that can heal or incinerate. When a small or larger creature dies within 30 feet of you or your wildfire spirit, a harmless spectral flame springs forth in the dead creature’s space and flickers there for 1 minute. As a free action at the beginning of your turn, you can extinguish the spectral flame there and either heal or deal fire damage to a creature that has passed through the flames on its last turn. The healing or damage equals 2d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

You can use this talent a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Blazing Reival

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Cauterizing Flame
The bond with your wildfire spirit can save you from death. If the spirit is within 120 feet of you when you are reduced to 0 stamina and thereby fall unconscious, you can cause the spirit to drop to 0 hit points. You then regain half your stamina and immediately rise to your feet.

Once you use this talent, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
