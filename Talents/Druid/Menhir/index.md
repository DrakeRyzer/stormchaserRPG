# Menhir
Some druids study the paths of nature’s power through the nodes and ley lines that connect standing stones and megalithic circles, learning to tap into their energies.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
You gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a circle spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have a circle spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

## Talents

### Spirit Sense
As an action, you can open your awareness to detect otherworldy and magical beings. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any astral, ethereal, fey, incorporeal, outsider, or undead creature within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

### Place Magic
*Prerequisite:* 3rd Level Spells and Spirit Sense<br>
A menhir savant learns to identify and tap into ley lines in different types of terrain. As a free action, they can tap into the magic of a nearby ley line and increase their spellcasting ability bonus by +1 for 1 round. They can use this ability a number of times per day equal to their base spellcasting ability bonus.

### Walk the Lines
*Prerequisite:* 5th level Spells and Place Magic<br>
A menhir savant can use their connection to ley lines to cast *Transport via Plants* a number of times per day equal to their spellcasting ability bonus.

### Scorching Spirit
*Prerequisite:* 7th level Spells and Walk the Lines<br>
A menhir savant can become ethereal as an action, as if using *Etherealness*. They can remain ethereal for a number of rounds per day equal to twice their maximum spell level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
