# Firethorn
Firethorn druids devote themselves to being a true force for nature, seeking to drive back those that encroach upon, lack respect or exploit nature. These druids are not afraid to make their presence known at the front of this battle. Their ability to call upon nature and transform their body into a weapon makes them well suited for this calling. Once their foes are dispatched, they call upon the cleansing fires so that nature may reclaim its territory.

## Branch Features

### Branch Spells
Once you can cast spells of the corresponding level, you may spend character points equal to twice the spell's level to have that spell always prepared. Spells bought in this manner don't count against the number of spells that you can prepare.
 
If you have a branch spell that doesn’t appear on the [Divine Spell List](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Divine/), that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Thorn Growth

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 1
*You can sprout thorns and vines from your body. They protect you from incoming blows and can be used offensively.* 

You can expend mana to sprout these vines. You gain 1d4 + 4 temporary stamina for the 1st point of mana spent and 5 additional temporary stamina for each point of mana spent thereafter. The maximum amount of mana that you may spend for one use is equal to the maximum spell level that you can cast. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:
* You gain +1d to Strength ability checks and Strength defence vs attacks that are neither melee nor ranged.
* Your thorns count as unarmed melee weapons with the [close](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Weapons/Glossary/#close) and [light](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Weapons/Glossary/#light) properties dealing 1dM + your Strength modifier piercing damage. 
* When you successfully grapple a creature, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage.
* You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all the temporary stamina or use Wild Shape.

### Plant Stride
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Thorn Growth<br>**Actions:** 1

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Extra Attack<br>**Actions:** Free<br>**Trigger:** You are hit by an attack from a creature within 30 feet of you.
*You quickly expel some of your thorns with a burst of fiery energy.*

Make an evocation attack roll vs the Dexterity defence of a creature within 30 feet of you that hit you with an attack within the last round. On a hit, it takes 1d8 piercing and 1d8 fire damage, or half as much on a miss.

### Scorching Spirit

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Burning Thorns
*The fiery spirit of nature grows within you and sits just below the surface, ready to provide you protection.*

You gain the following benefits:
* You are immune to fire damaage.
* Creatures that you grapple automatically take 1d8 fire damage if you maintain the grapple at the end of your turn. Additionally, creatures that grapple you automatically take 1d8 fire damage if they maintain the grapple at the end of their turn. 
* If you drop to 0 hit points and remain unconscious, at the beginning of your next turn your spirit appears as a ***fire elemental*** in an unoccupied space next to your body. This form cannot regain lost hit points and you remain in this form until your body receives healing or you fail three death saving throws. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
