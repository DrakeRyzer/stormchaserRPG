# Firethorn
Firethorn druids devote themselves to being a true force for nature, seeking to drive back those that encroach upon, lack respect or exploit nature. These druids are not afraid to make their presence known at the front of this battle. Their ability to call upon nature and transform their body into a weapon makes them well suited for this calling. Once their foes are dispatched, they call upon the cleansing fires so that nature may reclaim its territory.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you take your first talent from this branch, you gain proficiency with martial axes and bludgeons.

### Bonus Spells
When you take your first talent from this branch, you learn the Thorn Whip cantrip. If you already know that cantrip you may learn another cantrip of your choose from the disciple spell list. 

Additionally, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

### Thorn Growth

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 1
*You can sprout thorns and vines from your body, which protects you from incoming blows as well as being used offensively.* 

You can expend mana to sprout these vines. You gain 1d4 + 4 temporary stamina for the 1st point of mana spent and 5 additional temporary stamina for each point of mana spent thereafter. The maximum amount of mana that you may spend for one use is equal to the maximum spell level that you can cast. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:
* You benefit from +1d to your Strength defence and Strength-based skill checks.
* Your thorns count as melee weapons dealing 1d6 + your Strength modifier piercing damage. Using your thorns as a melee weapon does not increase the multiattack penalty for other melee weapons and vice versa.
* When you successfully grapple a creature, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage.
* You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all the temporary stamina or use Wild Shape.

### Extra Attack

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Thorn Growth<br>**Actions:** 1
You can make a second Strike action without taking the multiattack penalty.

### Burning Thorns

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Extra Attack<br>**Actions:** Free<br>**Trigger:** You are hit by an attack from a creature within 30 feet of you.
*You gain the ability to quickly expel some of your thorns with a burst of fiery energy.*

When a creature hits you with an attack, it must make a Dexterity defense check vs your spellcasting skill. It takes 1d10 piercing + 1d10 fire damage + your spellcasting ability modifier on a fail, or half as much on a success.

This ability triggers once per round and automatically on the first attack to hit you each round, unless you declare on your turn or when you roll intitiative that it will trigger from attacks by a specified creature, or not to use it at all. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

### Scorching Spirit

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Burning Thorns
*The fiery spirit of nature grows within you and is just below the surface, ready to provide you protection.*

You gain the following benefits:
* You are immune to fire damaage.
* Creatures that you grapple automatically take 1d8 fire damage if you maintain the grapple at the end of your turn. Additionally, creatures that grapple you automatically take 1d8 fire damage if they maintain the grapple at the end of their turn. 
* If you drop to 0 hit points and remain unconscious, at the beginning of your next turn your spirit appears as a ***fire elemental*** in an unoccupied space next to your body. This form cannot regain lost hit points and you remain in this form until your body receives healing or you fail three death saving throws. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
