## Stonecunning

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Mountain Hall Culture
*You have a knack for noticing even small inconsistencies and craftsmanship techniques in the stonework around you.*

You benefit from +1d on [Perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Specific/Perception/) checks to notice unusual stonework. This bonus applies to checks to discover mechanical traps made of stone or hidden within stone.

If you aren't using the [Seek](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Seek/) action or searching, the GM automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice unusual stonework anyway. This check doesn't benefit from the bonus.

## Greater Shadow Magic

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Shadowland Culture
You know the [Darkness]() spell. Charisma is your spellcasting attribute for this spell.
