# Monk Talent Tree
For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield. It is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. These warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be.

### Martial Arts
#### 5 character points
Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are short swords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or unwieldy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armour or wielding a shield:
* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.
* You learn the brawling fighting style. If you already know the brawling fighting style, gain 5 character points.
* You treat monk weapons as unarmed strikes. If the weapon's damage die is smaller than your martial feat die, use your martial feat die.

### Dance of the Crane
#### 5 character points
While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your speed increases by 10 feet and you may use your Wisdom defence in place of your Strength or Dexterity defence versus melee and ranged attacks.

Additionally, the first time each round that you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, you can deflect or catch the missile as a free action. When you do so, the damage that you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.

### Chi
#### 5 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Martial Arts and Dance of the Crane
Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of chi. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of chi points equal to your Wisdom modifier.

You can spend these points to fuel various chi features. You start knowing 7 such features: Deflect Missiles, Flurry of Blows, Focussed Aim, Patient Defense, Quickened Healing and Step of the Wind.

If you spend 1 chi point or more as part of your action on your turn, then you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.

When you spend a chi point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended chi back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your chi points.

As long as you have 1 chi point remaining, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Some of your chi features require you to make a chi attack roll versus your target's defence. This is an attack roll using your unarmed proficiency and your Wisdom bonus.

#### Dedicated Weapon
Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your chi on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:
* The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.
* You must be proficient with it.
* It must lack the unwieldy and special properties.

#### Deflect Missiles
If you catch a missile that was shot at you, you can spend 1 chi point to make a ranged attack as a free action with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

#### Flurry of Blows
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

#### Focussed Aim
When you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 2 chi points to reroll your attack roll, potentially turning the miss into a hit.

#### Patient Defense
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

#### Quickened Healing
As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and roll your recovery die. You regain an amount of stamina equal to the number rolled plus your wisdom bonus.

#### Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

### Stunning Strike
#### 5 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Chi and 4 Other Monk Talents
You can interfere with the flow of chi in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 chi point to attempt a stunning strike. If your chi attack hits the target's Constitution defence, they are stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Calm in the Storm
#### 15 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Stunning Strike and 5 Other Monk Talents
Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that deals only half damage on a miss, you instead take no damage on a miss, and only half damage on a hit.

Additionally, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Flying Crane
#### 20 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Calm in the Storm and 6 Other Monk Talents
When you fall, reduce any falling damage that you take by an amount equal to five times your number of monk talents.

Additionally, your unarmoured speed bonus increass to 20 feet and you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.
