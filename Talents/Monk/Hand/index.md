### Open Hand Technique

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You can manipulate the chi that flows through your enemies as you bring forth your own. Whenever you make a [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/), you can spend a chi point to impose one of the following effects on the target:
* Compare your attack roll plus your Wisdom modifier to the target's Strength defense. On a hit, the target is pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
* Compare your attack roll plus your Wisdom modifier to the target's Dexterity defense. On a hit, the target is knocked [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/).
* Compare your attack roll plus your Wisdom modifier to the target's Constitution defense. On a hit, the target is [Dazed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Dazed/) until the end of its next turn.

### Wholeness of Body

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Open Hand Technique and 4 other Monk Talents<br>**Actions:** 2
*You gain the ability to heal yourself.*

Roll 4 recovery dice and regain Stamina equal to the total. You must finish a long rest before you can use this talent again.

### Tranquility

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Wholeness of Body and 7 Bard Talents
*You enter a meditative trance that surrounds you with an aura of peace.*

At the end of a long rest, you gain the effects of a [Sanctuary]() spell, which lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal).

### Quivering Palm

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Tranquility and 10 other Bard Talents
*You gain the ability to manipulate lethal vibrations in another creature's body.*

When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 chi points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. The vibrations are harmless unless you use an action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, make a chi attack roll vs the target's Constitution defense. On hit, the target is reduced to 0 stamina. On a miss, the target takes 10d10 decay damage.

You can only have one creature under this effect at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.
