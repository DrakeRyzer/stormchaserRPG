#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Tranquility and 10 other Bard Talents
You gain the ability to manipulate lethal vibrations in another creature's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 Chi points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your total Monk talents. The vibrations are harmless unless you use an action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, you make a Chi attack roll against the target's Constitution defense. On hit, the target is reduced to 0 stamina. On a miss, the target takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can only have one creature under this affect at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.
