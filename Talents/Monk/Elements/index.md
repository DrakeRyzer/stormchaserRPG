# Four Elements
You follow a tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your chi, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Many members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but a talented few can weave the elements together. 

Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their chi powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains and cresting waves.

## Elemental Speciality
When you take your first talent in this branch, you choose an element as your preferred element. Each element has an opposing element: air vs earth and water vs fire. Your preferred and opposed elements do not change any effects or bonuses received from talents within the branch. When you choose your preferred Element, future branch talents that require a choice of element are affected in the following ways:
* Talents that require a choice of elemental specialisation can be taken multiple times, each time gaining access to the benefits of a new element. If a prerequisite talent has an elemental specialisation, you must have that element chosen already to take the new talent with the same specialisation.
* After you choose your preferred element with your first talent, the CP cost is doubled for talents that specialise in your opposed element.

### Elemental Conduit

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
Your fundamental teaching holds that channeling the elements is not so much a matter of mastery and control, but instead allowing yourself to become a medium of expression. Through this expression, you learn to project the elements as you would extensions of your body.

Choose an element from the list below. When you hit a target with an Unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/), you add a bonus effect for the chosen element. If you have taken this talent multiple times, you can choose which elemental effect is used, but no more than one effect can be added to each Strike.
* **Fire:** The target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using an action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
* **Air:** You can choose to push a target 5 feet in a direction of your choice, or knock them [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/). You may also choose to deal no damage. If you do, the target is pushed 5 feet and knocked [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/).
* **Water:** The target is [Slowed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Slowed/) until the end of your next turn
* **Earth:** You can change the damage type of your Unarmed Strike to piercing rather than bludgeoning. On a hit, the target is [Staggered](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Staggered/) until the end of their next turn

### One with the Elements

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Elemental Conduit and 4 Other Monk Talents
Your attunement to the elements affects your body, mind and soul. Choose an element from the list below. You gain the benefit associated with it. If you take this talent multiple times with different elements, you can change the benefit by meditating as part of a short rest.

* **Water:** Your reach is increased by 10 feet. If a target was [Slowed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Slowed/) when this attack hits, they are now [Grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) as ice begins to encase their body with each successful attack. A [Grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) target becomes [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) and a [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) target becomes [Pinned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Pinned/).
