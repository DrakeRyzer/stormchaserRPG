# Four Elements
You follow a tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Many members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but some achieve a greater skill to weave the elements together. 

Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.

# Elemental Specialty
When you take your first talent in this branch, you choose an element as your Preferred Element. Each element has an Opposed Element: Air vs. Earth, and Water vs. Fire. Your Preferred and Opposed elements do not change any effects or bonuses received from talents within the branch. When you choose your Preferred Element, future branch talents requiring a choice of element are affected in the following ways:

* Talents requiring a choice of elemental specialization can be taken multiple times, each time gaining access to the benefits of a new element. If a prerequisite talent has an elemental specialization, you must have that element chosen already to take the new talent with the same specialization.
* After you choose your Preferred Element with your first talent, the CP cost is doubled for talents that specialize in your Opposed Element

### Elemental Conduit

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
Your fundamental teaching holds that channeling the elements is not so much a matter of mastery and control, but instead allowing yourself to become a medium of expression. Through this expression, you learn to project the elements as you would extensions of your body.

Choose an element from the list below. When you hit a target with an Unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/), you add a bonus effect for the chosen element. If you have taken this talent multiple times, you can choose which elemental effect is used, but no more than one effect can be added to each Strike.

* **Fire:** The target suffers [Persistent Fire Damage (2)] until the end of their next turn.
* **Air:** You can choose to push a target 5 feet in a direction of your choice, or knock them [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/). You may also choose to deal no damage. If you do, the target is pushed 5 feet and knocked [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/).
* **Water:** The target is [Slowed]() until the end of your next turn
* **Earth:** You can change the damage type of your Unarmed Strike to piercing rather than bludgeoning. On a hit, the target is [Staggered]() until the end of their next turn

### One with the Elements

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Elemental Conduit and 5 Other Monk Talents
Your attunement to the elements affects your body, mind, and soul. Choose an element from the list below. You gain the benefit associated with it. If you take this talent multiple times with different elements, you can change the benefit when you spend a Long or Short Rest to regain Chi Points.

* **Fire:** You gain resistance to fire and lightning damage, and your attacks of opportunity inflict [Persistent Fire Damage (2)]() on the target
* **Air:** Your movement speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, your [Leap](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Leap/) distance increases by 15 feet horizontally and 5 feet vertically.
* **Water:** You gain a swim speed equal to your movement speed and are not affected by difficult terrain caused by ice or similar surface-level effects.
* **Earth:** You gain [Tremorsense](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Special/#tremorsense) (30 feet). If you already have [Tremorsense](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Special/#tremorsense) from another source, its range increases to 45 feet and becomes a precise sense

### Elemental Soul

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** One with the Elements and 8 Monk Talents
Your connection to the four elements grows to masterful harmony with your very soul. When you attack using your Elemental Conduit, your Unarmed [Strikes](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) also gain the following benefits. 

* **Fire:** Your attack range is increased by 10 feet and deals half damage to an additional target you choose within 5 feet of the first. The [Persistent Fire Damage]() damage now equals your Wisdom modifier to the primary target. 
* **Air:** Your attack range is now increased by 15 feet and your forced movement can affect up to two additional targets of your choice within 10 feet of the primary target. Additionally, you can move up to 10 feet once per turn after successfully hitting a target with your [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
* **Water:** Your attack range is now increased by 10 feet. If a target was [Slowed]() when this attack hits, they are now [Grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) as ice begins to encase their body with each successful attack. A target [Grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) when this attack hits becomes [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/), and a [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) target becomes [Pinned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Pinned/) on a hit.
* **Earth:** Your attack range increases by 5 feet and successful [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) against a [Staggered]() or [Slowed]() target immediately knocks them [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/). Additionally, when you take the [Dodge](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Dodge/) or [Guard](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Guard/) action, you create an earthen barrier in an open space within 5 feet of you or the target of your [Guard](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Guard/) action. The barrier has 5 DR and stamina equal to your Wisdom score. This barrier cannot move and provides standard cover. Any damage which exceeds the shield’s stamina is transferred to the target immediately behind it.

### Avatar of the Elements

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Elemental Soul (3 elemental specialties) and 12 other Monk Talents
Your connection with the elemental forces is absolute. Your soul is bonded to each of the elements so closely that they are now one and the same. You may spend 1 Action and 2 Chi points to enter an empowered state and gain the benefits listed below. This state can be Sustained for 1 Chi point at the start of subsequent turns to a maximum duration of 1 minute.

* You gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed
* Your Strike action’s range with Elemental Conduit and Elemental Soul is increased by 5 feet and you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage of these attacks
* You receive +1d to physical defenses and damage resistance to non-magic attacks as well as fire, ice, lightning, poison, and thunder damage
* The area within 10 feet of you becomes difficult terrain

### Master of the Eight Gates

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Elemental Conduit (4 elemental specialties), One with the Elements (4 elemental specialties), and 15 other Monk Talents
You have achieved a transcendent enlightenment that allows you to touch energies in the souls of others. You gain resistance to radiant, profane, and necrotic damage. Additionally, you can spend 1 action to perform one of the following effects a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier per Long rest:

* Make an Unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) against a target. On a hit, the target cannot cast spells until they finish a long rest.
* If you take the [Dodge](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Dodge/) or [Guard](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Guard/) actions, the next effect against you that deals radiant, profane, necrotic, fire, thunder, lightning, ice, or poison damage automatically misses.
