# Drunken Master
The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a drunka rd. A drunken master sways, tottering on unsteady feet, to present what seems like an incompetent combatant who proves frustrating to engage. The drunken master's erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats.

A drunken master often enjoys playing the fool to bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate humility to the a rrogant, but when battle is joined, the drunken master can be a maddening, masterful foe.
