# Ascendant Dragon
The dragon god is known to travel the world in the guise of a young monk. Legend says that he founded the first monastery of the ascendant dragon in this guise. The fundamental teaching of this tradition holds that by emulating dragons, a monk becomes a more integrated part of the world and its magic. By altering their spirit to resonate with draconic might, monks who follow this tradition augment their prowess in battle, bolster their allies and can even soar through the air on draconic wings. However, all of this is in service to a greater goal: achieving a spiritual unity with the essence of the world.
