# Mercy
Mercy monks learn to manipulate the life force of others to bring aid to those in need. They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt. However, to those beyond their help, they bring a swift end as an act of mercy.

Followers of this tradition might be members of a religious order, administering to the needy and making grim choices rooted in reality rather than idealism. Some might be gentle-voiced healers, beloved by their communities, while others might be masked bringers of macabre mercies.

The walkers of this way usually don robes with deep cowls and they often conceal their faces with masks, presenting themselves as the faceless bringers of life and death.

# Visage of Mercy
You gain a special mask, which you often wear when using the talents of this branch. You determine its appearance, or generate it randomly by rolling on the Merciful Mask table.

### Bringer of Mercy

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*The mystic gifts that you bring to the world have the supernatural ability to ease the suffering of the ailing. Wounds mend and toxins are purged, but there are times when fate has other plans. In these times, your gift brings a swift and peaceful end to those whom your touch finds.*
* **Hand of Healing:** Your mystical touch can mend wounds. As an action, you can spend 1 chi point to touch a creature and restore an amount of stamina equal to their martial feat die + your Wisdom modifier.
* **Hand of Harm:** You use your chi to inflict wounds. When you hit a creature with an unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/), you can spend 1 chi point to deal extra decay damage equal to one roll of your martial feat die + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature only once per turn.

### Physician's Touch

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Bringer of Mercy and 4 Other Monk Talents
*You can administer even greater cures with a touch and, if you feel it's necessary, use your knowledge to cause harm.*

When you use Hand of Healing on a creature, you can also end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the creature: [Blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/), [Deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/), [Paralyzed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Paralysed/), [Poisoned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Poisoned/), or [Stunned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Stunned/).

When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can subject that creature to the [Poisoned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Poisoned/) condition until the end of your next turn.

### Flurry of Healing and Harm

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Physician's Touch and 8 Monk Talents
*You can now mete out a flurry of comfort and hurt.*

You can use your Hand of Healing on two targets within 5 feet of you. Additionally, when you make an unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) with Flurry of Blows, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without spending the chi point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.

### Hand of Ultimate Mercy

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Flurry of Healing and Harm and 12 other Monk Talents
*Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy.*

As an action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 chi points. The creature then returns to life, regaining an amount of stamina equal to 4 of their martial feat dice + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died while subject to any of the following conditions, it revives with them removed: [Blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/), [Deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/), [Paralyzed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Paralysed/), [Poisoned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Poisoned/), or [Stunned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Stunned/).
