# Astral Self
An astral self monk believes that their body is an illusion. They see their chi as a representation of their true form, an astral self. This astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or disorder, with some monasteries training students to use their power to protect the weak and other instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true selves in service to the mighty.

## Forms of Your Astral Self
The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the monk's soul. As a result, an astral self doesn't necessarily look anything like the monk. For example, the astral self of a lanky human might be reminiscent of a minotaur, the strength of which the monk feels within. Similarly, an orc monk might manifest gossamer arms and a delicate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the orc's soul. Each astral self is unique, and some of the monks of this monastic tradition are known more for the appearance of their astral self than for their physical appearance.

When choosing this path, consider the quirks that define your monk. Are you obsessed with something? Are you driven by justice or a selfish desire? Any of these motivations could manifest in the form of your astral self.

### Arms of the Astral Self

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
Your mastery of your chi allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. As an action, you can spend 1 chi point to summon the arms of your astral self. When you do so, make a chi attack roll against the Dexterity defense of each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet. On a hit, each target takes energy damage equal to two rolls of your martial feat die.

For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms' appearance and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die.

While the spectral arms are present, you gain the following benefits:
* You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks.
* You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed [Strikes](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/).
* When you make an unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) with the arms on your turn, your reach is 5 feet greater than normal.
* The unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) that you make with the arms can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and their damage type is energy.

### Visage of the Astral Self

You can summon the visage of your astral self. As an action, or as part of the action that you take to activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend 1 chi point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It vanishes early if you are incapacitated or die.

The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet or mask. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral visage is present, you gain the following benefits.

### Body of the Astral Self

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Visage of the Astral Self and 8 Other Monk Talents
When you have both your astral arms and visage summoned, you can cause the body of your astral self to appear (no action required). This spectral body covers your physical form like a suit of armour, connecting with the arms and visage. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral body is present, you gain the following benefits:
* **Deflect Energy:** The first time that you take elemental, or energy damage, the damage that you take is reduced by your martial feat die + your Wisdom modifier.
