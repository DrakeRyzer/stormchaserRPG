# Astral Self
An Astral Self Monk believes their body is an illusion. They see their chi as a representation of their true form, an astral self. This astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or disorder, with some monasteries training students to use their power to protect the weak and other instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true selves in service to the mighty.

## Forms of Your Astral Self
The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the monk's soul. As a result, an astral self can reflect aspects of a monk's background, ideals, flaws, and bonds, and an astral self doesn't necessarily look anything like the monk. For example, the astral self of a lanky human might be reminiscent of a minotaur-the strength of which the monk feels within. Similarly, an orc monk might manifest gossamer arms and a delicate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the orc's soul. Each astral self is unique, and some of the monks of this monastic tradition are known more for the appearance of their astral self than for their physical appearance.

When choosing this path, consider the quirks that define your monk. Are you obsessed with something? Are you driven by justice or a selfish desire? Any of these motivations could manifest in the form of your astral self.

### Arms of the Astral Self

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. As an action, you can spend 1 chi point to summon the arms of your astral self. When you do so, make a chi attack roll against the Dexterity defense of each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet. On a hit, each target takes force damage equal to two Martial Feat dice.

For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms' appearance, and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die.

While the spectral arms are present, you gain the following benefits:

* You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed [Strikes](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/).
* When you make an unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) with the arm(s) on your turn, your reach is 5 feet greater than normal.
* The unarmed [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) you make with the arms can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and their damage type is force.

### Visage of the Astral Self

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Arms of the Astral Self and 5 Other Monk Talents
You can summon the visage of your astral self. As an action, or as part of the action you take to activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend 1 chi point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It vanishes early if you are incapacitated or die.

The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet or mask. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral visage is present, you gain the following benefits.

* **Astral Sight:** You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.
* **Wisdom of the Spirit:** You have advantage on [Insight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Insight/) and [Intimidation](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Intimidation/) checks.
* **Word of the Spirit:** When you speak, you can direct your words to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you, making it so only that creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can amplify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet can hear you.

### Body of the Astral Self

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Visage of the Astral Self and 8 Monk Talents
When you have both your astral arms and visage summoned, you can cause the body of your astral self to appear (no action required). This spectral body covers your physical form like a suit of armor, connecting with the arms and visage. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral body is present, you gain the following benefits.

* **Deflect Energy:** The first time you take cold, corrosive, fire, force, electric, or sonic damage, the damage you take is reduced by your Wisdom modifier + recovery die.
* **Empowered Arms:** Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the Arms of the Astral Self, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.

### Awakened Astral Self

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Body of the Astral Self and 12 other Monk Talents
Your connection to your astral self is complete, allowing you to unleash its full potential. As an action, you can spend 5 ki points to summon the arms, visage, and body of your astral self and awaken it for 10 minutes. This awakening ends early if you are incapacitated or die.

While your astral self is awakened, you gain the following benefits.

* **Armor of the Spirit:** You are considered Trained in each physical defense. If you are already Trained in a physical defense, you are considered 1 proficiency step higher (i.e. Trained becomes Expert, Expert becomes Master)
* **Astral Barrage:** The first time you take the [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action each turn, you make two attacks instead.
