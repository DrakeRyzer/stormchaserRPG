### Radiant Sun Bolt

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*You can hurl searing bolts of magical radiance.*

You gain a new attack option that you can use with the [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action. This special attack is a ranged evocation attack with a range of 30 feet. You use your unarmed proficiency in place of your evocation proficiency for this attack and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is sacred and its damage die uses your martial feat die.

### Searing Arc Strike

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Radiant Sun Bolt and 5 Other Monk Talents<br>**Actions:** 1
You gain the ability to channel your Chi into searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action on your turn, you can spend 2 chi points to cast the [Burning Hands](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Evocation/#burning-hands) spell as a single action.

You can spend additional ki points to cast [Burning Hands](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Evocation/#burning-hands) as a higher-level spell. Each additional chi point that you spend increases the spellâ€™s level by 1. The maximum number of chi points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend is determined by your [spellcasting talents](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Spellcasting/) (if any).

### Searing Sunburst

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Searing Arc Strike and 8 Monk Talents<br>**Actions:** 2
*You gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion.*

You magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant. Make a chi attack roll vs the Constitution defense of each creature within that 20-foot-radius sphere. On a hit, the creature takes 1d12 sacred damage. A creature that is behind opaque greater cover is automatically missed.

You can spend additional chi points up to your Wisdom modifier to increase the damage by one die for every chi point spent.

### Sun Shield

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Searing Sunburst and 12 other Monk Talents
*You become wreathed in a luminous, magical aura.*

You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as an action. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while the light shines, it takes radiant damage equal to 5 + your Wisdom modifier.
