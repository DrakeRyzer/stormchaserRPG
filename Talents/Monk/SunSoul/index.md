### Radiant Sun Bolt

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You gain a new attack option when you make an unarmed Strike: you can now choose to project a bolt of energy from your body. This attack uses the same attack and damage bonuses you receive when making a normal unarmed Strike (Training, Ability Modifier, etc.) as well as the damage dice size, but the damage type is now radiant and the range is 30 feet.

This special attack can also be used whenever a Monk talent specifies using an unarmed Strike.

### Searing Arc Strike

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Radiant Sun Bolt and 5 Other Monk Talents<br>**Actions:** 2
You gain the ability to channel your Chi into searing waves of energy. You can spend 2 Chi points to send forth a wave of fire in a 15 foot cone starting from your character. Make a chi attack roll against the Dexterity defense of each target within the affected area. On a hit, deal fire damage equal to your martial feat die.

### Searing Sunburst

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Searing Arc Strike and 8 Monk Talents<br>**Actions:** 2
You gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion. This magic orb moves from your space to a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant. Make a chi attack roll against the Constitution defense of every creature within a 20 foot radius of the target location. On a hit, creatures take radiant damage equal to 2 Martial Feat Dice. You can spend additional Chi points up to your Wisdom modifier to increase the damage by 1 die for every Chi point spent. Targets take half damage if they are behind standard cover, and no damage is taken if the target is behind greater cover.

### Sun Shield

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Searing Sunburst and 12 other Monk Talents<br>**Actions:** 3
You become wreathed in a luminous, magical aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light for 1 action. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while the light shines, they immediately take radiant damage equal to double your Wisdom modifier.
