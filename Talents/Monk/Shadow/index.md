# Shadow
Shadow monks follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes, the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anybody else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience from their students.
