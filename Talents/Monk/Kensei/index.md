# Kensei
Kensei monks train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point where the weapon becomes an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons.

A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way as a calligrapher or painter regards a pen or brush. Whatever the weapon, the kensei views it as a tool used to express the beauty and precision of the martial arts. That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion , practice, and study.

### Path of the Kensei

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
Your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. You gain the following benefits:
* **Kensei Weapons:** Choose two types of weapon to be your kensei weapons: one melee and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the unwieldy property. The longbow is also a valid choice, despite being unwieldy. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you.
* **Agile Parry:** If you make an unarmed strike and you are holding a kensei melee weapon, you can use it to defend yourself. As long as the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated, you gain +1d to your Defenses vs melee and ranged attacks until the start of your next turn.
* **Kensei's Shot:** You can use one action to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly. For the rest of your turn, any target that you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type.

### One With the Blade

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Path of the Kensei and 5 other Monk Talents
You extend your chi into your kensei weapons, granting you the following benefits:

- Chi-Infused Strikes: Attacks with your kensei weapons count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.
- Perfect Form: Once per turn, when you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 chi point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage equal to your martial feat die.

### Path of the Kensei II

You gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your ki. As an action, you can expend up to 3 chi points to grant one kensei weapon that you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of chi points that you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. When this feature is applied to a magic weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls, the total may cannot exceed +3.
