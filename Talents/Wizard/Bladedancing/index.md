# Bladedancing Tradition
Bladedancers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honour and expand on the elven ways.

In combat, a bladedancer uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladedancer to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a bladedancer at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.

## Features

### Training in War and Song
You gain proficiency with light armour and 1 martial weapon group.

You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it.

## Talents

### Bladedance
You can invoke magic called the Bladedance, provided that you aren't wearing medium or heavy armour or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

You can use a bonus action to begin the Bladedance, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armour or a shield, or if you use strength to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

While your Bladedance is active, you gain the following benefits:
* You may use your Intelligence defence in place of your Strength or Dexterity defence vs melee and ranged attacks.
* Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
* You have advantage on Dexterity (Athletics) checks.
* You gain a bonus to your Constitution defence score to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your intelligence bonus (round up), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short rest.

### Extra Attack
*Prerequisite:* 3rd Level Spells and Bladedance<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Additionally, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

### Dance of Defense
*Prerequisite:* 5th Level Spells and Extra Attack<br>
You can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active. If you took damage since your last turn, you may expend mana as a free action to reduce that damage by an amount equal to five stamina per mana expended. The maximum number of mana that may be used in this way in a single round is equal to the maximum spell level that you can cast. 

### Dance of Victory
*Prerequisite:* 7th Level Spells and Dance of Defence<br>
You can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage of your melee weapon attacks while your Bladesong is active.
