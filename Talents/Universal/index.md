# Universal Talents
A talent represents an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience and abilities.

You can take each talent only once, unless the description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a talent to take that talent. If you ever lose a talent’s prerequisite, you can’t use that talent until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler talent requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow (perhaps by a withering curse) you can’t benefit from the Grappler talent until your Strength is restored.

Talents marked with ᴮᴳ may be taken as background talents.
