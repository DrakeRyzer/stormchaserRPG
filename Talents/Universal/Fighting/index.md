- When you deal damage to a creature that includes your Strength modifier, you add twice your Strength modifier if that creature dealt damage to you since the start of your last turn.
- When you choose to let an attack hit you, the creature rolls the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.
  
  (Normally, you can choose to allow a miss to hit you. If you do so, the attacker chooses the maximum amount of damage instead of rolling.)

### Mastery
You've mastered returning pain to those who deliver it, becoming a scourge on the battlefield. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When a creature deals damage to you with a melee weapon, it provokes an opportunity attack from you. On a hit, your weapon dice deal maxiumum damage.

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are skilled at using your weight to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:
- You are proficient with improvised weapons.
- Your unarmed strike and impprovised weapon damage die increases by one step (e.g. from 1 to 1d4).

> The damage die size increases from brawling fighting style and brawling mastery **do** apply to the damage die of natural weapons. For example, the damage die of a longtooth shifter's fangs increases from 1d6 to 1d8.
> 
> If you use your martial feat die for your unarmed damage die, then the increased damage die size from brawling fighting style **does not** apply. For example, a warrior with a martial feat die of 1d6, brawling fighting style and the martial arts talent from the monk talent tree deals 1d6 damage with their unarmed strikes, not 1d8.
