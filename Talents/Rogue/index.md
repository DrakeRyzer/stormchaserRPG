# Rogue Talent Tree
Life is an endless adventure for those who live by their wits. Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any of dozens of other professions or talents. Thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues, as well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess, or luck. Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable opportunities of civilization, some embrace lives on the road, journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing fantastic danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches. In the end, any who desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms might come to be called rogues.

### Sneak Attack

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an additional 3dM damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The source of the advantage must be environmental (proficiency does not count). The attack may not use a weapon with the slow property.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it and that enemy isn't incapacitated.

Additionally, you can forego your Sneak Attack damage to force your target to roll on the [injury table](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/Injuries/) instead of taking stamina damage.

You have a wary eye, bordering on paranoia. When you roll for initiative, you can move up to your speed. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.

Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Steady Aim

As a bonus action you can give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
