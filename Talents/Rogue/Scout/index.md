# Scout
You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions. Rogues who embrace this profession are at home in the wilderness and among barbarians and rangers, and many Scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunterâ€”these are just a few of the roles that Scouts assume as they range the world.

### Skirmisher

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are difficult to pin down during a fight. When an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you automatically move away up to half your movement, avoiding damage and difficult terrain as much as possible.. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

### Survivalist

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
[**When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Nature and Survival skills if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those proficiencies.**] (This talent should probably be redone or removed entirely.)

### Superior Mobility

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Skirmisher and 8 other Rogue Talents
[**All of your movement speeds increase by 10 feet.**] (This feels lacking. If Survivalist drops entirely, maybe this 

### Ambush Master

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Superior Mobility and 12 other Rogue Talents
You gain +1d on initiative rolls. In addition, any creature you hit during combat that has not acted yet becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against an affected target gain +1d until the start of your next turn.

### Sudden Strike

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ambush Master and 16 other Rogue Talents
You can strike with deadly speed. If you take the [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action on your turn, your next [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) on the same turn does not suffer from multiple attack penalty. This second attack can benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target more than once in a turn.
