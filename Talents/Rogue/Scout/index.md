# Scout
You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions. Rogues who embrace this profession are at home in the wilderness and among barbarians and rangers. Many scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter. These are just a few of the roles that scouts assume as they range the world.

If you take the [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action on your turn, your next [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) on the same turn does not suffer from multiple attack penalty. This second attack can benefit from your [sneak attack](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Rogue/#sneak-attack) even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your [sneak attack](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Rogue/#sneak-attack) against the same target more than once in a turn.
