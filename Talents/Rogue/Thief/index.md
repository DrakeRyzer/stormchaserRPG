# Thief
You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses and other criminals typically follow this path, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages and using magic items that you normally couldnâ€™t employ.
