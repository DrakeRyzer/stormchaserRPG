# Thief
You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses and other criminals typically follow this path, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages and using magic items that you normally couldnâ€™t employ.

*Professional Thieves are adept at working in areas commonly overlooked by the common watchmen.*

You can use the free action granted by Cunning Action to make a Sleight of Hand check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the [Interact](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Interact/) action.

You also gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.
