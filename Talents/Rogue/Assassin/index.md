### Assassinate

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*You are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies.*

Any creature that hasn’t yet taken a turn in the combat is [flat-footed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Flatfooted/) towards you.

Additionally, any hit that you score against a creature to which you are [undetected](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#undetected) is treated as though you had rolled a natural 20.

### Infiltration Expertise

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Assassinate and 40 CP spent in Rogue talents
You can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.

Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.

### Impostor

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Infiltration Expertise and 100 CP spent in Rogue talents
You gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person’s speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person’s behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.

Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects that something is amiss, you have +1d on any [deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) check that you make to avoid detection.

### Death Strike

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Imposter and 250 CP spent in Rogue talents
*You become a master of instant death.*

You may [coup de grace](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Coup/) creatures to which you are [undetected](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#undetected), provided that you hit the creature with a melee or ranged attack roll.
