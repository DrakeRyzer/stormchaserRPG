### Assassinate

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5 CP spent in Rogue talents
You are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. Any creature that hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet is considered [flat-footed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Flatfooted/) for you. In addition, any time that you attack and hit a creature that is [flat-footed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Flatfooted/), you may add 1dM to you Sneak Attack damage.

### Infiltration Expertise

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 40 CP spent in Rogue talents
You can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.

Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.

### Impostor

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 100 CP spent in Rogue talents
You gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person’s speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person’s behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.

Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have +1d on any [Deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) check that you make to avoid detection.

### Death Strike

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 250 CP spent in Rogue talents
You become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is [flat-footed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Flatfooted/), also compare the attack roll to the creature's Constitution defence, as if you have performed a [Coup de Grace](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Coup/).
