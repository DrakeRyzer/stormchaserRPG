# Defence

## Style
You are skilled at the art of defending yourself. While you are wearing medium or heavy armour with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- You can use your bonus action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your next turn. When you do so, damage dealt to you by the target is reduced by an amount equal to half your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of +1) while marked. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.
- You have advantage on Strength checks to avoid being moved. Effects that would physically move you have disadvantage on their attack roll vs Strength defence.

## Mastery
You've mastered the art of defending yourself, treating your armour as a second skin. While you are wearing medium or heavy armour with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When you are hit by a melee or ranged attack, the damage roll has disadvantage.
- Once per round, when a creature makes a melee attack against you while within your reach, whether the attack hits or misses, the creature must make a Strength defence check vs your passive Strength (Athletics) skill or be shoved up to 10 feet directly away from you.
- The time that it takes for you to don and doff armour is reduced by half.
