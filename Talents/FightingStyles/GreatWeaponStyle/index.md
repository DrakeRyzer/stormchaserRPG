# Great Weapon

## Style
You are skilled at putting the weight of a weapon to your advantage. While you are wielding a melee weapon with the two-handed property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefit:
- When you roll a 1 or 2 on a weapon damage die, you can reroll the die once and keep the better result.
- Grasping a two-handed weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your object interaction.

## Mastery
You've mastered putting the weight of a weapon to your advantage, letting its momentum empower your strikes. While you are wielding a melee weapon with the two-handed property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- On your turn, when you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.
- When you miss with a melee weapon attack, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack against the same target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll. On a hit, this attack deals bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier.
- Before you make a melee weapon attack, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, your weapon dice deal maximum damage.
- While wielding the weapon in two hands, you have advantage on ability checks to avoid being disarmed. Attempts to disarm you suffer disadvantage.
