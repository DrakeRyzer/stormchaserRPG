# Talents
The combination of attributes, species, culture and background defines your character’s capabilities in the game. The personal details with which you describe your character set them apart from any other.

This section defines the rules for customising your character further: talents.

A talent represents an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience and abilities.

A talent may be taken by any character that meets the specified prerequisites and spends the necessary character points required to take the talent. Talents may be taken from multiple talent trees and from multiple branches of any given talent tree.

If you ever lose a talent’s prerequisite, then you can’t use that talent until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler talent requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow (perhaps by a withering curse), then you can’t benefit from the Grappler talent until your Strength is restored.

You can take each talent only once, unless the description says otherwise.
