# Talents
The combination of attributes, species, background and class defines your characterâ€™s capabilities in the game. The personal details with which you describe your character set them apart from any other. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do.

This section defines the rules for customising your character further: talents.

There are two broad categories of talents:
* **Universal talents** can be taken by any character that meets the talent's prerequisites and spends the necessary character points required to take the talent.
* **Talent trees** are each associated with a class. A single-classed character may only take talents from the talent tress that belong to that character's class.

Taking a talent from a tree belonging to a class other than your own requires you to [multiclass](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Multiclassing/).
