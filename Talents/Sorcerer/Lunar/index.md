# Lunar Sorcery
On many worlds, the moon is a revered celestial body with magical properties. You or someone from your lineage has been exposed to the concentrated magic of the moon (or moons) of your world, imbuing you with lunar magic. Perhaps your ancestor was involved in a druidic ritual involving an eclipse, or maybe a mystical fragment of a moon crashed near you. However you came to have your magic, your connection to the moon is obvious when you cast sorcerer spells. Perhaps your pupils glow with the colour of a moon from your world, causing spectral manifestations of lunar phases to orbit you, or some other effect.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
When you finish a long rest you can choose which lunar phase manifests its magic through you: Full Moon, New Moon, or Crescent Moon.

Based upon your chosen phase, you gain the following bonus spells, once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always know it and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.

If you have a bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the arcane spell list, that spell is nevertheless an arcane spell for you.

###  Lunar Embodiment

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*The moon provides you with an additional well of power.*

You can cast the 1st level spell on your chosen lunar phase spell list one time without expending any mana. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Moon Fire

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*You call down the radiant light of the moon on command.*

You learn the [Sacred Flame]() spell, which doesn’t count against the number of mage cantrips you know. When you cast this spell, you can target one creature as normal or target two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other.

###  Lunar Boons I
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3nd Level Spells , Lunar Embodiment, and Moon Fire
*The moon influences the flow of magic for your other abilities.*

Your current lunar phase can affect your Arcane Savant feature. Each phase is associated with certain schools of magic, as shown here:

**Full Moon:** Divination and warding spells

**New Moon:** Charms and necromancy spells

**Crescent Moon:** Illusion and transmutation spells

Whenever you use an Arcane Savant option on a spell of a school of magic associated with your current phase, you can reduce the additional mana needed to use the option by 1 (minimum 0). Once you can reduce the mana in this way, you can’t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

###  Waxing & Waning
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3nd Level Spells , Lunar Embodiment, and Moon Fire<br>**Actions:** 1
*You gain greater control over the phases of your lunar magic.*

You can spend 1 mana to change your current lunar phase to a different one.

You can now cast one 1st level spell from each lunar phase bonus spell list once without expending a spell slot, provided your current phase is the same as the lunar phase spell. Once you cast a lunar phase spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Lunar Boons II

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells, Lunar Boons I, and Waxing & Waning
You can now use your Lunar Boon ability twice before needing to complete a rest.

### Lunar Empowerment

#### **Cost:** 45 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells, Lunar Boons I, and Waxing & Waning
*The power of a lunar phase saturates your being.*

You also gain the following benefit associated with your chosen lunar phase:

**Full Moon.** You can use 1 Action to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet or to douse the light. In addition, you and creatures of your choice gain +1d on [Investigation]() and [Perception]() checks while within the bright light you shed.

**New Moon.** You gain +1d on [Stealth]() checks. In addition, while you are entirely in darkness, you gain +1d to your Strength and Dexterity defenses against melee and ranged attacks.

**Crescent Moon.** You have 1 instance of resistance to profane and sacred damage.

### Lunar Phenomenon
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 9th Level Spells and Lunar Empowerment<br>**Actions:** 1
*You can tap into a special power of your current lunar phase.*

Using 1 Action, or as part of the 1 Action you take to change your lunar phase using the Waxing & Waning feature, you can immediately use the power of the lunar phase you are in or entering:

**Full Moon.** You radiate moonlight for a moment. Make a spell attack vs the Constitution defense of each creature of your choice within 30 feet. On a hit, a creature is blinded until the end of its next turn. In addition, you can roll 2 Recovery Die of one creature of your choice within 30 feet and they regain stamina equal to the amount rolled.

**New Moon.** You momentarily emanate gloom. Make a spell attack vs the Dexterity defense against each creature of your choice within 30 feet. On a hit, a creature takes 3d10 profane damage and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. In addition, you become invisible until the end of your next turn, or until immediately after you make an attack roll or cast a spell.

**Crescent Moon.** You can magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. You can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of your destination space. In addition, you and that creature gain 1 instance of resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.

Once you use one of these benefits, you can’t use that benefit again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 mana to use it again.
