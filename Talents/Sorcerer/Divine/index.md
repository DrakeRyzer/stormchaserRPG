# Divine Soul
Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god’s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.

A divine soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a divine soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.

In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a divine soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.
