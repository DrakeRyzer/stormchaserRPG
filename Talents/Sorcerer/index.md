# Sorcerer Talent Tree (Mage)
Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals can imagine. Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters’ abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilise their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life itself.

## Spellcasting
When you take your first sorcerer talent, your spellcasting class feature for the mage class is affected in the following ways.

### Spellcasting Ability
Choose Constitution or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for your arcane spells. The power of your spells relies on your ability to harness the magic in your blood and project your will onto the world. You use use your chosen ability whenever a mage spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use the modifier of your chosen ability when making an attack roll with a mage spell that you cast.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the mage spell list.

Each time that you gain the ability to cast spells of a higher spell level, you learn 2 additional mage spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level that you can cast. For example, when you take the *2nd Level Spells* talent, you learn two new spells of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, whenever you gain a sorcerer talent, you can choose one of the mage spells that you know and replace it with another spell from the mage spell list, which must also be of a level that you can cast.

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 1 Other Sorcerer Talent
You tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by additional mana and the ability to create a variety of magical effects.

You gain an amount of additional mana equal to the total number of sorcerer talents that you have taken.

You also gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. Choose two of the following Arcane Savant options. You can use only one Arcane Savant option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

#### Careful Spell
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 additional mana and choose a number of those creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

#### Distant Spell
When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 additional mana to double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 additional mana to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

#### Empowered Spell
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 additional mana to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Arcane Savant option during the casting of the spell.

#### Extended Spell
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 additional mana to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

#### Heightened Spell
When you cast a spell for which you make an attack roll against a creature's defence, you can spend 3 additional mana to benefit from advantage on the attack roll vs one target of the spell.

#### Quickened Spell
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 additional mana to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

#### Seeking Spell
If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 additional mana to reroll the d20. However, you must use the new roll, even if it is worse.

You can use Seeking Spell even if you have already used a different Arcane Savant option during the casting of the spell.

#### Subtle Spell
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 additional mana to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

#### Transmuted Spell
When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 additional mana to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder.

#### Twinned Spell
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of additional mana equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 additional mana if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren’t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.
