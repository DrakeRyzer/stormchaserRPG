# Chaos Bloodline
Your innate magic comes from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to another plane. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause. However it came to be, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
Once you can cast spells of a given level, select two spells of that spell level from the list below as bonus spells. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always know it and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.

If you have a bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the arcane spell list, that spell is nevertheless an arcane spell for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
|:-----------:|:------:|
| 1st | Bane, Chaos Bolt, Colour Spray, Lubricate, Oil Slick |
| 2nd | Alter Self, Crown of Madness, Enlarge/Reduce, Mischief | 
| 3rd | Blink, Enemies Abound, Hypnotic Pattern, Summon Fey | 
| 4th | Confusion, Dimension Door, Greater Invisibility, Polymorph | 
| 5th | Animate Objects, Geas, Seeming, Synaptic State | 

### Wild Magic Surge
Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, after you cast an arcane spell of 1st level or higher, you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.
