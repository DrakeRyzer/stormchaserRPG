<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Shadow Elf
You have resistance to decay damage.

Additionally, as an action, you can magically teleport up to a distance equal to your speed to an unoccupied space that you can see. When you teleport using this ability, you also gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.

Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Fey Step

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Fey Elf<br>**Actions:** 1
You can magically teleport up to a distance equal to your speed to an unoccupied space that you can see. 

Your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season. If the effect requires an attack roll, you are considered trained and your attack bonus is equal to your Charisma modifier:
* **Spring:** When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within a distance of you equal to your speed.
* **Summer:** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).
* **Autumn:** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, make an attack roll vs the Wisdom defence of up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you. On a hit, they are charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to them.
* **Winter:** When you use your Fey Step, make an attack roll vs the Wisdom defence of one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport. On a hit, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
