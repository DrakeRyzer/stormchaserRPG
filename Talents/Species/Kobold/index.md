<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Kobold
Your tail is especially flexible and strong, so you’ve learned to use it for both movement and simple tricks. You can use your tail to draw items and make unarmed strikes, which can also be equipped with special weapons (see [Melee Weapons](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Weapons/MeleeWeaponTables/)).
