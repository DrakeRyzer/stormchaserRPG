<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Fey Elf
As an action, you can magically teleport up to a distance equal to your speed to an unoccupied space that you can see. 

Your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season. If the effect requires an attack roll, you are considered trained and your attack bonus is equal to your Charisma modifier:
* **Spring:** When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within a distance of you equal to your speed.
* **Summer:** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).
* **Autumn:** Immediately after you use your Fey Step, make an attack roll vs the Wisdom defence of up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you. On a hit, they are charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to them.
* **Winter:** When you use your Fey Step, make an attack roll vs the Wisdom defence of one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport. On a hit, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Tinker

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Gnome
Using artisan’s tools (tinker’s tools), you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 integrity). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.

When you create a device, choose one of the following options:
* **Clockwork Toy:** This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.
* **Fire Starter:** The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.
* **Music Box:** When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed.
