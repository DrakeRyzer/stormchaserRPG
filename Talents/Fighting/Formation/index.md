# Formation Fighting Style

## Style

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are skilled at fighting with a partner. While an ally is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
* Once per turn, you can take the [Guard](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Guard/) action as a free action.
* When you move on your turn, you can use an action to allow an ally within 5 feet of you to move with you (no action required by the ally). The ally must end this movement within 5 feet of you and this movement can't exceed the ally's speed.
* When you choose to let an attack that would hit a guarded ally hit you instead, the creature rolls the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.

## Mastery

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Formation Fighting Style
You've mastered fighting with a partner, learning to move and act as a single unit. While an ally is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
* When a creature within your reach misses an ally of yours with a melee attack, it provokes an opportunity attack from you.
* Each round, the first time that an ally within 5 feet of you is hit by a weapon attack and the result of the attack roll exceeds their defence by less than your martial skill, the attack misses them.
* When you take the [Guard](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Guard/) action, the target gains an additional +1d to its defences vs melee and ranged attacks, for a total of +2d.
