# Equilibrium Fighting Style

## Style

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are skilled at fighting without the confines of armour. While you are wearing light or no armour and not wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:
* You can use an action to mark a target within 30 feet that you can see until the end of your next turn. When you do so, you gain +1d to Dexterity defence vs effects that the target controls while marked. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.
* You have +1d to Dexterity checks to avoid being moved.

## Mastery

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Equilibrium Fighting Style
You've mastered fighting without the confines of armour, treating combat as an elegant dance. While you are wearing light or no armour and not wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:
* When a creature misses you with a weapon attack, it provokes an opportunity attack from you.
* Each round, the first time that a creature hits you with a weapon attack, if +1d to your defence score would cause the attack to miss, then the attack misses.
* Once per round, if you are disarmed and have a free hand, then you catch the weapon immediately.
