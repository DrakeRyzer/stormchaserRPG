#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Dueling Fighting Style
You've mastered the art of fighting with a single weapon, making one weapon feel like many. While you are wielding a weapon with which you are proficient in one hand and no other weapons, you gain the following benefits:
* When you miss with a weapon attack on your turn, you have +1d on your next attack against the same target.
* Each round, the first time that a creature hits you with a melee attack, if +1d to your defence score would cause the attack to miss, then the attack misses.
