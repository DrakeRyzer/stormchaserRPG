### Mastery

- Each round, the first time that you are the target of a melee weapon attack, your attacker provokes an opportunity attack from you. Do not add your proficiency bonus to your weapon skill for the purposes of determining the defence check DC. On a hit, the target suffers the attackâ€™s normal effects and you impose disadvantage on the attack roll made against you.
- Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while wielding a weapon in two hands, you can attempt to follow up on the attack. If the attack hits, make a secondary attack roll vs the creature's Strength defence. On a hit, the creature is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.
- Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while wielding a weapon in one hand, the target is wielding a shield, and your other hand is empty, you can use your other hand to pull down the shield as a free action. If you do so, the creature gains no benefit to Strength defence from its shield for that attack.
