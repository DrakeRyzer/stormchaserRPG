# Fighting Styles

## Twin-Blade

### Style
You are skilled at fighting with double-bladed weapons. While wielding a weapon with the double property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When you engage in Double-Weapon Fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of your Double-Weapon Fighting attack.
- When you attempt to shove a creature, instead of making a Strength (Athletics) check, you can instead make an attack roll. If you are wielding your weapon in two hands, you make this attack roll with advantage.

### Mastery
You've mastered fighting with double-bladed weapons, using both ends to devastating effect. While wielding a weapon with the double property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- Whenever you roll the maximum on a weapon damage die against a creature, you gain a +1 bonus to the next attack roll you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.
- You can engage in Double-Weapon Fighting even when the weapon you are wielding lacks the light property.
- Grasping a double weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your object interaction.
- Before you make a melee weapon attack, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, your weapon dice deal maximum damage.

## Versatile

### Style
You are skilled at using weapons in different ways. While you are wielding a melee weapon with the versatile property with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you gain the following benefits:
- When you miss with a melee weapon attack on your turn while wielding a weapon in two hands, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack roll against the same target using one hand. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll.
- When you miss with a melee weapon attack on your turn while wielding a weapon in one hand, you can use your bonus action to attempt to shove or trip that creature. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this ability check.
- Grasping a versatile weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires your object interaction.

### Mastery
You've mastered using weapons in different ways, altering your attack patterns mid-swing. While you are wielding a melee weapon with the versatile property with which you are proficient and other weapons, you gain the following benefits:
- Each round, the first time that you are the target of a melee weapon attack, your attacker provokes an opportunity attack from you. Do not add your proficiency bonus to your weapon skill for the purposes of determining the defence check DC. On a hit, the target suffers the attackâ€™s normal effects and you impose disadvantage on the attack roll made against you.
- Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while wielding a weapon in two hands, you can attempt to follow up on the attack. If the attack hits, make a secondary attack roll vs the creature's Strength defence. On a hit, the creature is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.
- Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while wielding a weapon in one hand, the target is wielding a shield, and your other hand is empty, you can use your other hand to pull down the shield as a free action. If you do so, the creature gains no benefit to Strength defence from its shield for that attack.
