# Duelist Fighting Style

## Style

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are skilled in the art of fighting with a single weapon. While you are wielding a weapon with which you are proficient in one hand and no other weapons, you gain the following benefit:
* You have +1d on feint attempts and to avoid being disarmed.
* Once on each of your turns, drawing or stowing a one-handed weapon no longer requires your object interaction.

## Mastery

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Duelist Fighting Style
You've mastered the art of fighting with a single weapon, making one weapon feel like many. While you are wielding a weapon with which you are proficient in one hand and no other weapons, you gain the following benefits:
* When you miss with a weapon attack on your turn, you have +1d on your next attack against the same target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as +1d, or -1d, also affect this attack roll.
* Each round, the first time that a creature hits you with a melee attack, if +1 to your defence score would cause the attack to miss, then the attack misses.
