# Disruption Fighting Style

## Style

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are skilled at fighting and interfering with spellcasters. You gain the following benefits:
* When you roll vs a creature's Constitution defence to break their concentration and miss, you can use an action to reroll. You must use the new roll.
* Once per round, when a hostile creature attempts to cast a spell while within 5 feet of you, they must first make a Constitution defence check of DC = 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell isn't cast and any mana is wasted.

## Mastery

* When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see casts a spell, they provoke an opportunity attack from you.
* You have +1d whenever you roll vs a creature's Constitution defence to make them break their concentration.
* If you've dealt damage to a spellcaster since the start of your last turn and can see that spellcaster, then you have +1d to your defences vs spells cast by that creature.
