# Berserk

## Style
You are skilled at returning pain to those who deliver it. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefit: 
- When you deal damage to a creature that includes your Strength modifier, you add twice your Strength modifier if that creature dealt damage to you since the start of your last turn.
- When you choose to let an attack hit you, the creature rolls the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.
  
  (Normally, you can choose to allow a miss to hit you. If you do so, the attacker chooses the maximum amount of damage instead of rolling.)

## Mastery
You've mastered returning pain to those who deliver it, becoming a scourge on the battlefield. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When a creature deals damage to you with a melee weapon, it provokes an opportunity attack from you. On a hit, your weapon dice deal maxiumum damage.
- When a creature scores a critical hit against you, you have advantage on the first attack you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.
- Effects that would force you to act against your will, be frightened, or prevent you from attacking a creature have disadvantage.
