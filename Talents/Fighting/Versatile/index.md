# Versatile Fighting Style

## Style

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are skilled at using weapons in different ways. While you are wielding a melee weapon with the versatile property with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you gain the following benefits:
* When you miss with a melee weapon attack on your turn while wielding a weapon in two hands, you benefit from +1d if you attack the same target while wielding the same weapon in one hand before the end of your turn.
* When you miss with a melee weapon attack on your turn while wielding a weapon in one hand, you benefit from +1d if you attempt to shove or trip that creature before the end of your turn.
* Grasping a versatile weapon you are wielding in only one hand with your other hand no longer requires an action.

## Mastery

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Versatile Fighting Style
You've mastered using weapons in different ways, altering your attack patterns mid-swing. While you are wielding a melee weapon with the versatile property with which you are proficient and other weapons, you gain the following benefits:
* Each round, the first time that you are the target of a melee weapon attack, your attacker provokes an attack of opportunity from you. On a hit, the target suffers the attackâ€™s normal effects and you impose -1d on the attack roll made against you.
* Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while wielding a weapon in two hands, you can attempt to follow up on the attack. If the attack hits, make a secondary attack roll vs the creature's Strength defence. On a hit, the creature is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking attacks of opportunity.
* Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while you are wielding a weapon in one hand, the target is wielding a shield and your other hand is empty, you can use your other hand to pull down the shield as a free action. If you do so, the creature gains no benefit to defence from its shield for that attack.
