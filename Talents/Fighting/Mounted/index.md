# Mounted Fighting Style

## Style

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are skilled at fighting while mounted. You gain the following benefits:
* Once per turn, you can take the [Mount](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Mount/) action as a free action.
* You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead, provided you are a valid target for that attack.

## Mastery

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Mounted Fighting Style
You've mastered the art of fighting while mounted, moving seamlessly with your companion. While you are mounted on a controlled creature, you gain the following benefits:
* Once per turn, you can choose to suffer -1d on a melee weapon attack roll against an unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount. If the attack hits, your weapon dice deal maximum damage.
* Each round, the first time that your mount is subjected to an effect that targets its Dexterity defence and deals only half damage on a miss, it instead takes no damage if it is missed and only half damage if it is hit.
* While mounted, your mount no longer shares your multi-attack penalty.
