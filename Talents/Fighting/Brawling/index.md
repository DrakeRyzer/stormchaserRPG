# Brawling

## Style
You are skilled at using your weight to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:
- You are proficient with improvised weapons.
- Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step.
- When you take the Attack action and attempt to grapple, shove, or trip a creature, or make an attack against a creature with an unarmed strike or a weapon wielded in one hand on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike, grapple, shove, or trip against the same creature.

## Mastery
You've mastered using your weight to your advantage, easily wrangling targets around. You gain the following benefits:
- Your improvised weapons use a d6 for damage and gain the versatile property.
- Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step.
- Your speed isn't halved by carrying a grappled creature who is the same size category as you or smaller. 
- Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or a weapon wielded in one hand on your turn, as a free action you can make an additional unarmed strike against the same target without the aid of your proficiency bonus.
