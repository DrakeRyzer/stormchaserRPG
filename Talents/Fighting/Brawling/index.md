# Brawling Fighting Style

## Style

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are skilled at using your weight to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:
* Your unarmed strike and improvised weapon damage die increases by one step (e.g. from 1 to 1d4).
* When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or an improvised weapon on your turn, you can attempt to grapple the target as a free action.

> The damage die size increases from brawling fighting style and brawling mastery **do** apply to the damage die of natural weapons. For example, the damage die of a longtooth shifter's fangs increases from 1d6 to 1d8.
> 
> If you use your martial feat die for your unarmed damage die, then the increased damage die size from brawling fighting style and brawling mastery **do not** apply. For example, a warrior with a martial feat die of 1d6, brawling fighting style and the martial arts talent from the monk talent tree deals 1d6 damage with their unarmed strikes, not 1d8.
