# Shield

## Style
You are skilled at using your shield to defend yourself, and you understand that shields are not just for protection but also for offense. While you are wielding a shield with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- If you are wielding a heavy shield, you are no longer required to wield a weapon with the light property in the other hand.
- You can use a bonus action to try to shove or trip a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield.

## Mastery
You've mastered using a shield to defend yourself. While you are wielding a shield with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- If you aren't incapacitated or already proficient in Dexterity defence, you can add shield bonus to your Dexterity defence vs indirect spells or other harmful effects.
- Each round, the first time that a creature that you can see damages you, the weapon dice deal minimum damage.
- Each round, the first time that you are missed by an effect that targets your Dexterity defence and deals half damage on a miss, you instead take no damage.
