# Covert

## Style
You are skilled at fighting from unseen angles. You gain the following benefits:
- You can take the Hide action as a bonus action. If you could already take the Hide action as a bonus action, you can once per turn instead take it as a free action on your turn.
- Creatures you've dealt damage to since the start of your last turn have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find you.

### Mastery
You've mastered fighting from unseen angles, gaining an advantage over your foes. You gain the following benefits:
- You can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.
- Dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with an unarmed strike or weapon attack, making the attack doesn't automatically reveal your position.
- Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature with an unarmed strike or weapon attack while hidden from it, your weapon dice deal maximum damage.
