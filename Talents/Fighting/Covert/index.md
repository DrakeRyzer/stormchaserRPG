#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Covert Fighting Style
You've mastered fighting from unseen angles, gaining an advantage over your foes. You gain the following benefits:
* You can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.
* Dim light doesn't impose -1d on your [Perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/) checks that rely on sight.
* When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with an unarmed strike or weapon attack, making the attack doesn't automatically reveal your position.
