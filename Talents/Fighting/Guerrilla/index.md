#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points

* Once per turn, you can [Step](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Step/) as a free action.
* When you take the [Step](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Step/) action, you ignore non-magical difficult terrain, and you have +1d on the first ability check to avoid an effect that impairs your movement speed or forces you to move before the start of your next turn.

## Mastery

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Guerrilla Fighting Style
You've mastered maneuvering across the battlefield, sliding through openings that others might not see. You gain the following benefits:
* You can move through a hostile creature's space regardless of that creature's size.
* When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed (no action required) without provoking attacks of opportunity from that creature.
* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, if another enemy of the creature is within 5 feet of it, and that enemy isn't incapacitated, your weapon dice deal maximum damage.
* Each round, the first time that a hostile creature moves until you are within their melee reach, you [Step](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Step/) as a free action and move half your speed away from them. If you encounter an obstacle or hazard, you take the shortest route around it. If this is not possible, then you stop. If you could already [Step](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Step/) as a free action and move up to half your speed (such as if you are a Scout Rogue), then you also do this the second time that a hostile creature moves until you are within their melee reach.
