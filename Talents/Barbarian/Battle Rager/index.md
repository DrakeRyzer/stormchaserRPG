# Battle Rager
Known as Kuldjargh (literally “axe idiot”) in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and they specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor. They throw themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.

## Optional Restriction: Dwarves Only
Only dwarves can become Battleragers. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.

### Battlerager Armour
When you choose this talent, you gain the ability to use spiked armor (see the “Spiked Armor” sidebar) as a weapon.

While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds, then for each round that you maintain the grapple.

### Reckless Abandon
*Prerequisite:* X Barbarian Talents
Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.

### Battlerager Charge
*Prerequisite:* X Barbarian Talents
Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are raging.

### Spiked Retribution
*Prerequisite:* X Barbarian Talents
Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3 piercing damage if you are raging, aren’t incapacitated, and are wearing spiked armor.
