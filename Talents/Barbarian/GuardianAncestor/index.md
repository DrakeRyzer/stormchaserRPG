# Guardian Ancestor
Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.

Barbarians who draw on their guardian ancestors can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their guardian ancestors, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

### Ancestral Protectors, Lesser

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rage 
Spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage to bolster your ranks. While you’re raging, the first attack before the start of your next turn that targets an ally within 10' receives -1d to the attack roll. You can instead choose to declare an ally within 10' to receive this protection before the end of your current turn. THis effect can only trigger once per round.

### Spirit Shield

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ancestral Protectors and 4 other Barbarian Talents
The guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. Once per round, if you are raging and an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can reduce that damage by 2d6 as a free action.

This increases to 3d6 when you take your 3rd Guardian Ancestor talent and to 4d6 when you take your 4th Guardian Ancestor talent.

### Consult the Spirits

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Spirit Shield and 7 other Barbarian Talents
You gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the augury or clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

After you cast either spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Ancestral Protectors

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 115 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ancestral Protectors, Lesser and 7 other Barbarian Talents
The range at which you can provide protection to allies with your Ancestral Protectors increases to 15'

### Vengeful Ancestors

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Consult the Spirits and 10 other Barbarian Talents
Your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.

### Ancestral Protectors, Greater

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ancestral Protectors and 10 other Barbarian Talents
You can now protect every ally within range using your Ancestral Protectors. Each ally can benefit from its effect only once per round for the first attack against them.
