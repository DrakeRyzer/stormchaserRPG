# Guardian Ancestor
Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a guardian ancestor barbarian rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.

Barbarians who draw on their guardian ancestors can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their guardian ancestors, these barbarians cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

### Ancestral Protectors, Lesser

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rage 
*When you enter your rage, a spectral warrior appears to defend you and your allies.*

While you’re raging, the time each round that you or an ally within 10 feet of you is targeted by an attack, the target receives +1d to its defences vs that attack.

On your turn (or when you roll initiative), you can declare a specific creature to trigger this ability, or to not use it for the next round. This effect can only trigger once per round. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.

### Spirit Shield

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ancestral Protectors and 4 other Barbarian Talents
*The guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend.*

Once per round, if you are raging and an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can reduce that damage by 2d6 as a free action.

This increases to 3d6 when you take your 3rd Guardian Ancestor talent and to 4d6 when you take your 4th Guardian Ancestor talent.

### Consult the Spirits

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Spirit Shield and 7 other Barbarian Talents
You gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the augury or clairvoyance spell as a ritual, without using mana or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Ancestral Protectors

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ancestral Protectors, Lesser and 7 other Barbarian Talents
The range at which you can provide protection to allies with your Ancestral Protectors increases to 15'

### Vengeful Ancestors

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Consult the Spirits and 10 other Barbarian Talents
Your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.

### Ancestral Protectors, Greater

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ancestral Protectors and 10 other Barbarian Talents
You can now protect every ally within range using your Ancestral Protectors. Each ally can benefit from its effect only once per round for the first attack against them.
