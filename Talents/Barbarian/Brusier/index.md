### Reckless Strikes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
While you are raging, not wearing heavy armor, and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to -1d to the attack roll to make the attack a reckless strike.

You can use these feature a combined number of times equal to your Constitution Modifier. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

#### Bracing Strike
You gain temporary hit points equal to your stamina die. If the target is grappled by you, you instead gain temporary hit points equal to twice your stamina die.

#### Punishing Strike
Make a weapon attack vs the Constitution defence of your target. On a hit, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.

#### Staggering Strike
Make a weapon attack vs the Strength or Dexterity defence of your target (the target chooses the ability score to use). On a hit, your target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead knocked prone.

### Shattering Strikes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Reckless Strikes and 4 Barbarian Talents
*Your rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials.* While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.
- Your narmed strikes and improved weapons deal double damage against structures and objects.

### Stop Hitting Each Other

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Shattering Strikes and 7 Barbarian Talents
You can grapple creatures two sizes larger than you, instead of one. 

Additionally, you can use creatures you have grappled that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so, and you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, the grappled creature takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.

### Hulking Smash

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br> **Prerequisite:** Stop Hitting Each Other and 10 Barbarian Talents
When you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, your critical hit range increases by 1 for that attack, and on a hit, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling.
