# Feral Soul
Feral Soul Barbarians  draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian. Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal spirit or be descended from shape-shifters.

### Form of the Beast
#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
When you enter your rage, you can transform, revealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it, as normal.

You choose the weapon’s form each time you rage:

**Bite.** Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you regain stamina equal to your recovery die, provided you have less than half your hit points when you hit.

**Claws.** Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it’s empty. It deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.

**Tail.** You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. You can use your tail to defend against one creature of your choice within 10 feet. You receive +1d on your strength and dexterity defenses against the target's next attack that targets you.

### Bestial Soul
#### *Cost:* 10 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Form of the Beast and 4 Other Barbarian Talents
The feral power within you increases, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

You can also alter your form to help you adapt to your surroundings. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you finish your next short or long rest:

**Climbing**
You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Jumping**
When you jump, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check and extend your jump by a number of feet equal to the check’s total. You can make this special check only once per turn.

**Swimming**
You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.


### Infectious Fury
#### *Cost:* 25 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Bestial Soul and 7 Other Barbarian Talents
When you hit a creature with your natural weapons while you are raging, the beast within you can curse your target with rabid fury. If your attack roll exceeds the target's wisdom defense, they suffer one of the following effects (your choice):

   - The target instantly makes a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see.
   - The target takes 2d12 psychic damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Call the Hunt
#### *Cost:* 50 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Infectious Fury and 10 Other Barbarian Talents
The beast within you grows so powerful that you can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of other willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 5 temporary stamina for each creature that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends, the chosen creatures gain 1d6 extra damage on their attacks

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
