# Wild Magic
Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic. These magic-suffused barbarians carry the Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.

## Branch Feature: Rage Power, Magic Awareness
As an action, you can spend 1 open your awareness to the presence of concentrated magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any spell or magic item within 60 feet of you. When you sense a spell, you learn which school of magic it belongs to. Do you not need to be raging to use this feature.

| d8 | Effect |
|:--:|:------:|
| 1 | Shadowy tendrils lash around you. Make a rage attack roll against the constitution defense each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you . On a hit, the target(s) take 1d12 necrotic damage. You also gain 1d12 temporary stamina when this effect activates. |

At the end of the current turn, the spirit explodes, and you make a rage attack roll against the dexterity defense of each creature within 5 feet of it to inflict 1d6 force damage on a hit. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again, summoning another spirit, on each of your turns as a bonus action. |

Until your rage ends, the weapon’s damage type changes to force, and it gains the light and thrown properties, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the weapon leaves your hand, the weapon reappears in your hand at the end of the current turn. |
| 5 | Whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll before your rage ends, that creature takes 1d6 force damage, as magic lashes out in retribution. |
| 6 | Until your rage ends, you are surrounded by multi­colored, protective lights; you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and while within 10 feet of you, your allies gain the same bonus. |
| 7 | Flowers and vines temporarily grow around you; until your rage ends, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies. |
| 8 | A bolt of light shoots from your chest. Make a rage attack roll against the constitution defense of another creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. |

### Bolstering Magic
#### *Cost:* 10 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Wild Surge and 4 Other Barbarian Talents
You can harness your wild magic to bolster yourself or a companion. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature:

   - For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a your Martial Feat Die whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add half the number rolled to the result.<br>
   - Roll a d3. The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals the number rolled or lower (the creature’s choice). Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can’t receive it again until after a long rest.

You can take this action a number of times equal to your constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Unstable Backlash
#### *Cost:* 25 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Bolstering Magic and 7 Other Barbarian Talents
When you are imperiled during your rage, the magic within you can lash out. Once per round, if you take damage or are subjected to a negative condition (excluding unconscious) while raging, you can roll on the Wild Magic table at the start of your next turn and immediately produce the effect rolled. This effect replaces your current Wild Magic effect.

### Controlled Surge
#### *Cost:* 50 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Unstable Backlash and 10 Other Barbarian Talents
Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to unleash. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.
