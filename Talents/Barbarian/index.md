# Barbarian Talent Tree
For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques. They are not soldiers or professional warriors, they are the battle-possessed. Creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilised and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.

**As long as at least half of your warrior talents are from the barbarian talent tree, your stamina increases to 5× your Constitution score and your recovery die increases to a d12**

### Rage
#### 5 character points
You fight with a primal ferocity; you have a number of rage points equal to your Constitution modifier. These rage points can be spent to trigger [rage powers](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Warrior/Barbarian/RagePowers/). Once you have spent a rage point, it is unavailable to you until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which your number of rage points is reset to equal your Constitution modifer. You also gain 1 rage point whenever:
* You hit a hostile creature with an attack for the first time that round.
* You are hit by an attack for the first time that round.
* You score a critical hit.
* You or an ally suffers a critical hit.
* You drop below half of your stamina maximum.
* An ally falls unconscious or dies.

Rage points gained in these ways may exceed your rage point maximum.

All barbarians start with the following rage power:

> #### Rage
> On your turn, you can spend a rage point to enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armour:
> * You have advantage on Strength checks.
> * When you make a melee weapon attack, you deal additional damage equal to your martial feat die.
> * You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
> 
> If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
> 
> Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or been hit by an attack since then. You can also end your rage at any time (no action required).

As a barbarian gains talents, they learn to use their rage in new ways. When you take your 3rd barbarian talent, you also gain a [rage power](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Warrior/Barbarian/RagePowers/). You gain another [rage power](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Warrior/Barbarian/RagePowers/) for every two barbarian talents of barbarian taken after the 3rd. A barbarian gains the benefits of [rage powers](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Warrior/Barbarian/RagePowers/) only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.

Any barbarian who meets the powers' prerequisites can select and use rage powers. Totem [rage powers](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Warrior/Barbarian/RagePowers/) grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem [rage powers](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Warrior/Barbarian/RagePowers/); for example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem [rage power](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Warrior/Barbarian/RagePowers/) cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem [rage powers](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Warrior/Barbarian/RagePowers/) (any [rage power](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Warrior/Barbarian/RagePowers/) with "dragon totem" in its title).

### Natural Resilience
#### 5 character points
You have innate Damage Reduction equal to your Constitution modifier. This DR does not stack with armour, but when wearing armour you may use the better of your Constitution modifier or the armour's DR.

Additionally, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. Attack rolls for effects that you can see, such as traps and spells, that target your Dexterity defence have disadvantage. You also have advantage on Dexterity defence checks against such effects. To gain this benefit, you can’t be [blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/), [deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/), or [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/).

### Reckless Attack
#### 5 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Rage
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Fast Movement
#### 5 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Reckless Attack
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armour.

### Feral Instinct
#### 10 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Natural Resilience
Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/), you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Instinctive Pounce
#### 5 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Fast Movement
As part of the bonus action that you take to enter your rage, you can move up to half your speed.

### Brutal Critical
#### 20 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Instinctive Pounce
You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

You may take this talent up to three times.

### Relentless Rage
#### 35 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Rage and Feral Instinct
Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution defence check at the start of your next turn. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this talent after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Brutal Critical II
#### 30 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Brutal Critical and Relentless Rage
You can now roll two additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

### Persistent Rage
#### 65 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Relentless Rage
Your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

### Brutal Critical III
#### 40 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Brutal Critical II and Persistent Rage
You can now roll three additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

### Indomitable Might
#### 80 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* Brutal Critical III
If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion
#### 100 character points
#### *Prerequisite:* 15 Other Barbarian Talents
You embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.
