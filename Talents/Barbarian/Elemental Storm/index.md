# Elemental Storm
All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Some learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them. When in a fury, this barbarian taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.

Elemental storm barbarians are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other elemental storm barbarians hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

### Storm Aura

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
You emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose fire, lightning, or cold. Your aura’s effect depends on that chosen element, as detailed below.

If your aura’s effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

**Fire:** When this effect is activated, roll your martial feat die and deal that much damage to all other creatures in your aura.

**Lightning:** When this effect is activated, choose one other creature that you can see in your aura. Make a rage attack against the target's dexterity defense. On a hit, roll your martial feat die twice. The target takes lightning damage equal to the result, or half as much damage on a miss.

**Cold:** When this effect is activated, roll your martial feat die. Each creature of your choice in your aura gains temporary stamina equal to the resulty, as icy spirits inure it to suffering.

### Storm Soul

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Cost:* 10 Character Points<br>*Prerequisite:* Storm Aura and 4 Other Barbarian Talents
The storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn’t active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

**Fire:** You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.

**Lightning:** You gain resistance to lightning damage and a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

**Cold:** You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.

### Shielding Storm

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Cost:* 25 Character Points<br>*Prerequisite:* Storm Soul and 7 Other Barbarian Talents
You learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice within your Storm Aura gains the damage resistance granted by the Storm Soul feature.

### Raging Storm

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Cost:* 50 Character Points<br>*Prerequisite:* Shielding Storm and 10 Other Barbarian Talents
The power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

**Fire:** Once per round, if a creature hit you with an attack while within your Storm Aura since the end of your last turn, then you may make a rage attack against its Dexterity defence as a free action at the start of your turn. On a hit, roll your martial feat die twice. The target takes fire damage equal to the result, or half as much damage on a miss.

**Lightning:** When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, the target is knocked prone if your attack roll exceeds its Strength defense.

**Cold:** Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can make a rage attack against the Strength defense of one creature that you can see within your aura. On a hit, the target's movement speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.
