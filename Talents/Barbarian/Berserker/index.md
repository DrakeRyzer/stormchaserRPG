# Berserker
For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end, that end being violence. The path of the berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

## Talents

### Frenzy
*Prerequisite:* Rage<br>
You can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

### Mindless Rage
*Prerequisite:* Frenzy<br>
You can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

### Intimidating Presence
*Prerequisite:* Mindless Rage<br>
You can use your bonus action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature must be able to see or hear you. Make a proficient Charisma attack roll vs. the creature's Wisdom defence. If you hit, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If you miss, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

### Retaliation
*Prerequisite:* Intimidating Presence<br>
Once each round, the first time that you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, the creature must make a Strength or Dexterity defence check (creature's choice) vs. your weapon skill. If the creature fails, you hit it with a melee attack.
