### Reckless Strikes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
While you are raging and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to suffer -1d on the attack roll to make the attack a reckless strike.

You can use these feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

#### Bracing Strike
You gain temporary hit points equal to your recovery die plus your Constitution modifier. If the target is grappled by you, then you instead gain temporary hit points equal to two recovery dice plus your Constitution modifier.

#### Punishing Strike
Make a melee weapon attack vs the Constitution defence of your target. On a hit, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.

#### Staggering Strike
Make a melee weapon attack vs your target. On a hit, the target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead knocked prone.

### Shattering Strikes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Reckless Strikes and 4 Other Barbarian Talents
*Your rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials.*

While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.
- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons deal double damage against structures and objects.

### Stop Hitting Each Other

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Shattering Strikes and 7 Barbarian Talents
You can grapple creatures up to two sizes larger than you, instead of one size larger than you. 

Additionally, you can use creatures that you have grappled that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so and you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, the grappled creature takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.

### Hulking Smash

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br> **Prerequisite:** Stop Hitting Each Other and 10 Barbarian Talents
When you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with a circumstancial +1d, you can choose to forgo the +1d. If you do so, your critical hit range increases by 1 for that attack.
