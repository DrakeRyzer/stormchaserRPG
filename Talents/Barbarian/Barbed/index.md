# Barbed
Known as Kuldjargh (literally “axe idiot”) in Dwarvish, barbed barbarians are dwarf followers of the gods of war and they specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armour. They throw themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.

## Optional Restriction: Dwarves Only
In most settings, only dwarves can become barbed barbarians. They fill a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.

### Barbed Armour

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
While you are wearing spiked armour and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one unarmed strike against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal piercing damage equal to your martial feat die. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, if your grapple check succeeds, then the target takes piercing damage equal to your martial feat die. This damage roll recurs on each round that you maintain the grapple.

When you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary stamina equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.
