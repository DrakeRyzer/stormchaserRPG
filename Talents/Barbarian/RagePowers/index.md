## Trample

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Rage Point Cost:** 1 Point
As an action, the barbarian can spend a rage point and attempt to overrun any creature that is the same size or smaller than itself. This works just like the overrun combat action, but the barbarian does not need to make a check, it merely has to move over opponents in its path.

Targets of the overrun take an amount of damage equal to the barbarian’s rage damage + its Constitution modifier and may make an opportunity attack, but with -1d. If a target forgoes its opportunity attack, it may attempt to avoid the barbarian creature and make a Dexterity defence check against the barbarian's skill to take half damage.

The barbarian can only deal this damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.

## Whirlwind

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Rage Point Cost:** 1 Point
Your rage drives you across the battlefield on a vicious, reaping path. You can spend 1 rage point to attack a target, then move to attack another target. The second target must be close enough to reach in melee with your remaining move distance. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. Do not add your ability score modifier to the attack or damage roll of these attacks. You can repeat this effect for 1 rage point as long as you have enough move remaining during your turn.
