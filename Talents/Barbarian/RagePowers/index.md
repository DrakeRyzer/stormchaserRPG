# Rage Powers
Any barbarian who meets a power's prerequisites can select and use a rage power. Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers. For example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with "dragon totem" in its title).

At the end of this movement, the target falls prone.

## Seize the Prey

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Cost:* 10 Character Points<br>*Prerequisite:* None<br>**Rage Point Cost:** 2 Point
While you grapple a target while raging, if you have a free hand, you can attempt to strangle the target in place of an unarmed attack. Make a rage attack roll. On a hit, you deal no damage, but begin strangling the target. A target one size larger than you requires two hands to do this. A target two sizes larger than you cannot be strangled in this way. Each round, you must spend an action to maintain the strangle hold. As long as you do so, the target is [suffocating](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/Suffocating/).

You have resistance to damage from corporeal sources, as long as they are magic (and no damage from non-magical weapons and objects). Likewise, corporeal creatures have resistance to damage dealt by any magical effects that you create. Your manufactured and natural weapons count as ghost touch weapons while incorporeal in this manner. Spells and other effects that do not deal damage function normally. While you are incorporeal, you can pass through a wall or other surface that is up to 5 feet thick per barbarian talent that you have. You must exit the solid material by the end of your turn.

## Shadow Totem, Greater

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

Once per rage, you can attempt to sunder an ongoing spell effect by succeeding at a [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action. For any effect other than one on a creature, you must make your [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) roll against a DC of 15 plus the spell's level. To sunder an effect on a creature, the melee attack must also hit the creature, ignoring any miss chance caused by a spell or spell-like ability. If successful, you suppress the effect for 1 round, or 2 rounds if you exceed the DC by 5 or more.

## Trample

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points<br>*Prerequisite:* None<br>**Rage Point Cost:** 1 Point
As an action, the barbarian can attempt to overrun any creature that is the same size or smaller than itself. This works just like the overrun combat action, but the barbarian does not need to make a check, it merely has to move over opponents in its path.

Targets of the overrun take an amount of damage equal to the barbarian’s rage damage + its Constitution modifier and may make an opportunity attack, but with -1d. If a target forgoes its opportunity attack, it may attempt to avoid the barbarian and make a Dexterity defence check against the barbarian's skill to take half damage.

The barbarian can only deal this damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.

## Whirlwind

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### *Cost:* 10 Character Points<br>*Prerequisite:* None<br>**Rage Point Cost:** 1 Point
Your rage drives you across the battlefield on a vicious, reaping path. Make a [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action against a target, then move to up to your movement speed to another target. The second target must be close enough to reach in melee with your remaining move distance. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. Do not add your ability score modifier to the attack or damage roll of these attacks. You can repeat this effect for 1 extra rage point as long as you have enough move remaining during your turn.
