While raging, the barbarian gains a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of piercing damage plus the barbarian's Strength modifier. The barbarian may spend a rage point to make a bite attack as a bonus action. If the barbarian already has a bite attack, its damage die increases by one step.

Additionally, a barbarian can spend a rage point to make a bite attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple. This attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the bite attack hits, any grapple checks made by the barbarian against the target this round have +1d.

## Auspicious Mark
The barbarian has been marked by the spirits, as indicated by an impressive tattoo, scar, or birthmark they possess. Once per rage, as a free action that costs 2 rage points, the barbarian can call upon the spirits' favor. Using auspicious mark lets them add +1d to one d20 roll that they have just made. They can call on the auspicious mark after seeing the result of the d20 roll.

If you critically hit the target when triggering this rage power, then they are [stunned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Stunned/) until the beginning of your next turn.

## Great Throw
When you throw a ranged weapon, you can put the full force of your rage behind it. By spending up to 3 rage points, you can add an additional weapon damage die for each point spent in this way. If you spend at least 2 rage points in this way, the target is also knocked prone. Your maximum range also increases by 5 times your Strength modifier and your long range threshold replaces your short range.

## Intimidating Glare
The barbarian can spend a rage point to make an Intimidation check against one adjacent foe as a bonus action.

## Leap to the Fray!
You can spend 3 rage points as part of your move to leap into the air. The distance can be up to your maximum move distance for the turn and the height is equal to 5 times your Strength modifier. If you attack at the end of this movement, you can roll any damage that you would ordinarily take from falling as additional damage on your attack.

## Reaping

## Scatter the Hordes
While you are grappling a target of equal or smaller size, you can spend 3 Rage Points to throw them. As an action, make an unarmed attack roll. On a hit, you throw them a distance equal to 5 times your Strength modifier in any direction that you choose. If the target hits something before the end of this distance, roll your rage damage die once for every 5 feet of distance remaining. The target takes this much damage. At the end of this movement, the target falls prone.

## Seize the Prey
When you grapple a target while raging, if you have a free hand, then you can spend 1 rage point strangle the target in place of an unarmed attack. On a hit, you deal no damage, but begin strangling the target. A target one size larger than you requires two hands to do this. A target two sizes larger than you cannot be strangled in this way. Each round, you must spend an attack to maintain the strangle hold. As long as you do so, the target is [suffocating](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/Suffocating/).

## Trample
As an action, the barbarian can spend a rage point and attempt to overrun any creature that is the same size or smaller than itself. This works just like the overrun combat action, but the barbarian does not need to make a check, it merely has to move over opponents in its path.

Targets of the overrun take an amount of damage equal to the barbarian’s rage damage + its Constitution modifier and may make an opportunity attack, but with -1d. If a target forgoes its opportunity attack, it may attempt to avoid the barbarian creature and make a Dexterity defence check against the barbarian's skill to take half damage.

The barbarian can only deal this damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.

## Whirlwind
Your rage drives you across the battlefield on a vicious, reaping path. You can spend 1 rage point to attack a target, then move to attack another target. The second target must be close enough to reach in melee with your remaining move distance. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. Do not add your ability score modifier to the attack or damage roll of these attacks. You can repeat this effect for 1 rage point as long as you have enough move remaining during your turn.
