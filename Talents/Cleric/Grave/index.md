# Grave
Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.

## Branch Features
 
### Branch Spells
Once you can cast spells of the corresponding level, you may spend character points equal to twice the spell's level to have that spell always prepared. Spells bought in this manner don't count against the number of spells that you can prepare.
 
If you have a branch spell that doesn’t appear on the [Divine Spell List](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Divine/), that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Circle of Mortality
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*You gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death.* 

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore stamina with a spell to a creature at 0 stamina, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. 

You also learn the [Spare the Dying](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Restoration/#spare-the-dying) cantrip, which doesn't count towards the number of divine cantrips that you know. For you, it can be cast using 1 action, does not require verbal components to cast and has a range of 30 feet.

### Eyes of the Grave
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 1
*You can occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life.* 

You can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you anything about a creature’s capabilities or identity.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Path to the Grave

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Prerequisite:** Channel Divinity and Circle of Mortality<br>**Actions:** 2
*You can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature’s life force for termination.* 

You choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack’s damage, and then the curse ends. 

### Sentinel at Death’s Door

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells, Circle of Mortality and Eyes of the Grave<br>**Action:** Free<br>**Trigger:** A creature in range suffers a critical hit.
*You gain the ability to impede death’s progress.* 

When you or a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, that hit is turned into into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled. 

This ability triggers once per round and automatically on the first critical to occur against you or a creature in range, unless you declare on your turn (or when you roll intitiative) which creature being attacked you wish to benefit from this ability, or not to use it at all. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Keeper of Souls

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 8th Level Spells and Sentinel at Death's Door<br>**Action:** Free<br>**Trigger:** Over the course of the last round, an enemy that you can see and is neither a construct nor undead died within 60 feet of you.
*You can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living.*

At the start of your turn, if an enemy that you can see and is neither a construct nor undead has died within 60 feet of you since the end of your last turn, then you or one creature of your choice that is within 60 feet of you may roll a recovery die and regain stamina equal to the total. If the creature that died was larger than the recipient of the healing, then the recepient may roll one additional recovery die for each size category between them. For example, if an ogre (large) dies, then a human (medium) may roll 2 recovery dice.

You can use this feature only if you aren't incapacitated. Once you use it, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.
