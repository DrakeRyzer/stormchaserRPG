# Grave
Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.

## Branch Features

As a grave cleric, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

Using 2 actions, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack’s damage, and then the curse ends.

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

You also learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which doesn't count towards the number of cleric cantrips that you know. For you, it can be cast using 1 action, does not require verbal components to cast and has a range of 30-feet.

Additionally, you gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. Using 2 actions, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you anything about a creature’s capabilities or identity.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Keeper of Souls

You can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living.

You can use this feature only if you aren't incapacitated. Once you use it, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.
