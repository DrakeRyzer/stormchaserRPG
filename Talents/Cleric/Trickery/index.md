# Trickery
Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order amongst both gods and mortals. They’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception and theft rather than direct confrontation.

## Branch Features

### Branch Spells
Once you can cast spells of the corresponding level, you may spend character points equal to twice the spell's level to have that spell always prepared. Spells bought in this manner don't count against the number of spells that you can prepare.
 
If you have a branch spell that doesn’t appear on the [Divine Spell List](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Divine/), that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 1
*Your deity bestows the ability to move unseen.*

You touch a willing creature, granting +1d on stealth checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.

#### Invoke Duplicity

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
##### **Prerequisite:** Channel Divinity<br>**Actions:** 2<br> **Duration:** Sustained
*You create a perfect illusory image of yourself.* 

Using 2 Actions for your Channel Divinity, you create an illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you no longer sustain the effect (as if you were sustaining a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. Using 1 Action on subsequent turns, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have +1d on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.
