# Nature
Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves. Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. However, many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.

## Branch Features
 
### Branch Spells
When you take your first talent in this branch, you learn the [Druidcraft](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Transmutation/#druidcraft) cantrip, if you do not already know it. If you already know this cantrip, then you learn a cantrip of your choice from the [Divine Spell List](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Divine/). This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of divine cantrips that you know.

Additionally, once you can cast spells of the corresponding level, you may spend character points equal to twice the spell's level to have that spell always prepared. Spells bought in this manner don't count against the number of spells that you can prepare.
 
If you have a branch spell that doesn’t appear on the [Divine Spell List](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Divine/), that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Verdant Weapon

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*You have cultivated a piece of flora that can sprout into a weapon to enforce your will upon the enemies of nature.*

You spend 10 minutes focusing your diety's power into a seed, flower, or other tiny piece of plant material. You imbue this piece of flora with the essence of a particular [weapon](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Weapons/) of your choice. When holding the imbued item, you can spend 1 action to cause it to immediately grow into the chosen weapon; 1 action returns it to its plant form. Your verdant weapon functions as the weapon until you revert its form. It can be used as your holy symbol. If the created weapon requires ammunition, you create 20 pieces of an appropriate type, though you may also use other appropriate types of ammunition with the created weapon.

You can have only one verdant weapon at a time. If you imbue a second seed or plant, your first immediately becomes a mundane specimen.
