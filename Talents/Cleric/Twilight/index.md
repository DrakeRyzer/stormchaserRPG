# Twilight
The twilit transition from light into darkness often brings calm and even joy, as the day’s labours end and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against the horrors of the night. Clerics who serve these deities bring comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.

## Branch Features
 
### Bonus Proficiencies
