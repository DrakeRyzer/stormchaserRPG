# Twilight
The twilit transition from light into darkness often brings calm and even joy, as the day’s labours end and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against the horrors of the night. Clerics who serve these deities bring comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.

## Branch Features
 
### Branch Spells
Once you can cast spells of the corresponding level, you may spend character points equal to twice the spell's level to have that spell always prepared. Spells bought in this manner don't count against the number of spells that you can prepare.
 
If you have a branch spell that doesn’t appear on the [Divine Spell List](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Divine/), that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.
