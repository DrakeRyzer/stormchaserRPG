# Death
The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities are often patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder, pain, disease or poison, and the underworld.
