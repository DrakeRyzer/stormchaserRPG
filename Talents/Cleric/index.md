# Cleric Talent Tree (Disciple)
In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater purpose. Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people. Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.

### Channel Divinity

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 1 Other Cleric Talent
You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you gain additional cleric talents, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you expend 1 mana and choose which effect to create. Some Channel Divinity effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

#### Turn Undead
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Make an attack roll against each undead within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you. On a hit, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take make opportunity attacks. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Destroy Undead

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 2nd Level Spells and Channel Divinity
When an undead is hit by your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below half your number of cleric talents.

### Divine Strike I

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 4th Level Spells and 3 Other Cleric Talents
The cleric gains the ability to infuse their weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of the cleric's turns when they hit a creature with a weapon attack, the cleric can cause the attack to deal an additional 1d8 damage to the target. This damage is of a type appropriate to the theme of the cleric's deity. A few examples are listed below:

| Divine Domain | Recommended Divine Strike Damage Type |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| Death | Necrotic |
| Forge | Fire |
| Life | Radiant |
| Nature | Cold, Fire, or Lightning |
| Order | Psychic |
| Tempest | Thunder |
| Trickery | Poison |
| Twilight | Radiant |
| War | Same as weapon |

### Divine Intervention

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and 3 Other Cleric Talents
You can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. Multiply the number of cleric talents that you have by 2. If you roll a number equal to or lower than this total, then your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any disciple spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

If you have 20 or more cleric talents, your call for intervention succeeds automatically and no roll is required.

### Divine Strike II

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and 4 Other Cleric Talents
Your Divine Strike damage increases to 2d8.

### Prophet

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 100 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 10th Level Spells and 6 Other Cleric Talents
You are the perfect servant of your God. Your spellcasting ability score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score also increases by 4.
