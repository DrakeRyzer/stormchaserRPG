# Light

Gods of light promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul’s improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

#### **Prerequisite:** Channel Divinity
You can use your channel divinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing sacred damage to your foes. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. 

Additionally, make a spellcasting attack versus the Constitution defense of each hostile creature within 30 feet of you. On a hit, a creature takes sacred damage equal to 2d10 + spellcasting modifier, and half as much damage on a miss. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

You can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. The first time each round that you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, the attacker takes -1d to hit, as the flaring light distracts them. You may decide not to use this feature or that it is triggered by certain creatures. This choice should be declared at the end of your turn.

An attacker that can’t be blinded is immune to this feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
