# Order
The Order domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to the laws that govern a society, an institution, or a philosophy. Clerics of Order meditate on logic and justice as they serve their gods.

Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws establish legitimate hierarchies and that those selected by law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability, and if those who lead fail to protect the law, then they must be replaced. In this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that create order and security in a chaotic multiverse.
