# Order
The Order domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to the laws that govern a society, an institution, or a philosophy. Clerics of Order meditate on logic and justice as they serve their gods, examples of which appear in the Order Deities table.

Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws establish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability, and if those who lead fail to protect the law, they must be replaced. In this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that create order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
You gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

#### **Prerequisite:** Channel Divinity
You can use your Channel Divinity to exert an intimidating presence over others. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and make a spellcasting attack against each creature of your choice that you can see or hear you within 30 feet of you vs their Wisdom defense. On a hit a creature is charmed by you until the end of your next turn or until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You can invoke the power of law to embolden an ally to attack. If you cast a spell using mana and target an ally with the spell, that ally can use a free action at the beginning of their next turn to make one weapon or cantrip attack against a creature of your choice that you can see. If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.

### Embodiment of the Law 
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and  Voice of Authority 
You have become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others.

If you cast a spell of the enchantment school using a mana of 1st level or higher, you can change the spell’s casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting, provided the spell’s casting time is normally 1 action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting modifier, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Order's Wrath
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 8th Level Spells and Embodiment of the Law 
Enemies you designate for destruction wilt under the combined efforts of you and your allies. If you deal your Divine Strike damage to a creature on your turn, you can curse that creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the target also takes 2d8 psychic damage, and the curse ends. You can curse a creature in this way only once per turn.
