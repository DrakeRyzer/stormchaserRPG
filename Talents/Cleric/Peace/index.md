# Peace
The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing.

Clerics devoting themselves to peace preside over the signing of treaties and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics' blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another's burdens, and the cleric's magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.

## Branch Features

### Balm of Peace

#### **Prerequisite:** Channel Divinity
You can use your channel divinity to make your very presence a soothing balm. As an action, you can move up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. When you move within 5 feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore an amount of stamina to that creature equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.

### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this branch, you are trained in your choice of the insight, performance or persuasion skill.
 
### Bonus Spells
You gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.
 
If you have a bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You can forge an empowering bond amongst people who are at peace with one another. As an action, you choose a number of willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes, or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature benefits from +1d to one attack roll or ability check that it makes each turn. Each creature can benefit from this additional die no more than once per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Protective Bond 
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Emboldening Bond 
The bond that you forge between people helps them to protect each other. When a creature affected by your Emboldening Bond feature takes damage, that damage is shared equally among all other bonded creatures. Any remaining damage is taken by the creature that was hit. 

This feature automatically triggers each time a bonded creature is hit up to a number of times per round equal to the number of bonded creatures. 

### Expansive Bond
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 8th Level Spells and Protective Bond 
The benefits of your Emboldening Bond and Protective Bond features now work when the creatures are within 60 feet of each other. Moreover, when a creature uses Protective Bond to take someone else’s damage, the creature has resistance to that damage.
