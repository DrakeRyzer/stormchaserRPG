# Peace
The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing.

Clerics devoting themselves to peace preside over the signing of treaties and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics' blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another's burdens, and the cleric's magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 2
*You can forge an empowering bond amongst people who are at peace with one another.*

You choose a number of willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes, or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature benefits from +1d to one attack roll or ability check that it makes each turn. Each creature can benefit from this additional die no more than once per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Balm of Peace

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Channel Divinity<br>**Actions:** 2
*You can make your very presence a soothing balm.*

Using your Channel Divinity, you can move up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. When you move within 5 feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore an amount of stamina to that creature equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting attribute modifier. A creature can receive this healing only one time on each of your turns when you use this ability.

### Protective Bond 
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Emboldening Bond 
*The bond that you forge between people helps them to protect each other.* 

When a creature affected by your Emboldening Bond takes damage, that damage is shared equally among all other bonded creatures within 60 feet of the creature that took the damage. Any remaining damage is taken by the creature that was hit. 

This feature automatically triggers each time a bonded creature is hit up to a number of times per round equal to the number of bonded creatures. 

### Expansive Bond
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 8th Level Spells and Protective Bond 
The benefits of your Emboldening Bond and Protective Bond features now work at twice the range - 60 feet and 120 feet, respectively. Moreover, the creatures sharing the damage from your Protective Bond have resistance to that damage that is shared.
