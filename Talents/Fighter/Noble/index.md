### Fighting Spirit

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 1
*Your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true.*

You gain +1d on weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so, you also gain 5 temporary stamina.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Elegant Courtier

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Fighting Spirit and 4 other Fighter Talents
*Your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations.*

You can use Wisdom instead of Charisma whenever you make a Persuasion check.

### Tireless Spirit

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Elegant Courtier and 6 other Fighter Talents
When you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.

Additionally, the temporary stamina granted by your Fighting Spirit increases to 10.

### Rapid Strike

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 65 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Tireless Spirit, and 9 other Fighter Talents
*You learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes.*

Once per turn, if you take the Strike action on your turn and are rolling 2d20 or more on an attack roll against one of the targets, you can take -1d for that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action.

Additionally, the temporary stamina granted by your Fighting Spirit increases to 15.

### Strength before Death

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rapid Strike and 11 other Fighter Talents
*Your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death to protect your honor.*

The first time that you would take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can delay falling unconscious. You immediately interrupt the current turn to take an extra turn. 

While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
