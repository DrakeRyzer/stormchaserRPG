Maneuvers are used by the [Fighter Talent Tree](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Fighter) and presented in alphabetical order. You may only use one maneuver once per turn.

## Commander's Strike
When you take the Strike action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use 1 action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. On that creature's next turn, they can make one weapon attack as a free action, adding your martial feat die to the attack's damage roll.

## Control Mount
When you make an animal handling check to influence a creature that you or an ally is riding, you can make the check with +1d. You add this die before or after rolling, but before applying the results of the check.

## Disarming Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add your martial feat die to the attack's damage roll, and if your attack roll exceeds the target's weapon skill, the target drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

## Distracting Strike
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. Add your martial feat die to the attack's damage roll and, until the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made against the target by an attacker other than you gains +1d.
