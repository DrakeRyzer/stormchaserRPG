Attacks made by you have +1d, and attacks made by hostile creatures against you have -1d. Additionally, you score a critical hit on a 19 and a 20.

#### **Moon Stance.**
*You strike with the wisdom of the moon.* While in this stance, you can add half your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one) to any melee weapon damage roll you make that doesn’t already include that modifier.

If there is another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach, you can attempt to deal the additional damage to that creature instead. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one). The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### **Stone Stance.**
*You become an unshakable wall of stone.* While in this stance, you have +1d on ability and defence checks to shove, trip, and avoid being moved, grappled, or knocked prone, you also ignore difficult terrain. Additionally, once per turn, when you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to shove the target up to 10 feet away from you (no action required).

#### **Water Stance.**
