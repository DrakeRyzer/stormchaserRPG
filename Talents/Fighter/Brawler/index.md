### Moxie

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*Your experience laying the beatdown on others has given you moxie that you can channel in the midst of battle.*

You have a number of moxie points equal to your Strength modifier. You can spend these points to fuel various moxie abilities. You have three such abilities: Brace Up, The Old One-Two, and Stick and Move. You regain all expended moxie points when you complete a short or long rest.

#### Brace Up

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

##### **Actions:** 1
You can spend 1 moxie point to brace for attacks. Roll your recovery die + your Constitution modifier and gain that many temporary hit points.

#### The Old One-Two

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

##### **Actions:** Free
Immediately after you take the Strike action, you may spend 1 moxie point to make an unarmed melee attack as a free action. This attack is subject to the multiattack penalty.

#### Stick and Move

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

##### **Actions:** Free
You can spend 1 moxie point to make a Fighting Dirty, Grapple, or Shove attack, or take the Dash action. Any attack made is subject to the multiattack penalty.

### Bloodied But Unbowed

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>Actions: Free
If, over the course of the last round, you took damage that reduced you to half your maximum stamina or less, then, as a free action at the start of your turn, you may choose to gain temporary stamina equal to your recovery die + your Constitution bonus. Additionally, you regain all expended moxie points. 

You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Haymaker

Before you make an attack, you can declare that you are swinging wild haymakers. You make all weapon attack rolls until the end of this turn with -1d. However, when you deal damage with a weapon or unarmed strike, you do not roll the weaponâ€™s damage die, but instead use the maximum die result.

### Moxie Fuelled Fists

When you use your Bloodied But Unbowed ability, you can choose to also use this ability. If you do, you add your martial feat die to your damage with unarmed attacks and weapons for the next minute.
