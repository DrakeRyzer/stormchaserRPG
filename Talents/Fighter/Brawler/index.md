# Brawler

### Improved Unarmed Strike

Your unarmed strikes deal base damage equal to your martial feat die.

### Moxie

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*Your experience laying the beatdown on others has given you a moxie you can channel in the midst of battle.* This swagger is represented by a number of moxie points. You have moxie points equal to half your fighter level (round down).

You can spend these points to fuel various moxie features. You know three such features: Brace Up, The Old One-Two, and Stick and Move. You regain all expended moxie points when you complete a short or long rest.

#### Brace Up

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Actions:** 1 action
You can spend 1 moxie point to brace for attacks. Roll your unarmed damage die + your number of fighter talents + your Constitution modifier and gain that many temporary hit points.

#### The Old One-Two
Immediately after you take the Strike action on your turn, you can spend 1 moxie point to make an unarmed strike as a free action.

#### Stick and Move
You can use 1 action and expend 1 moxie point to make a Fighting Dirty, Grapple, or Shove attack or take the Dash action.

### Bloodied But Unbowed

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
Additionally, When you take damage that reduces you to half your maximum hit points or less, you gain temporary stamina equal to your martial feat die + your Constitution score and you regain all expended moxie points.

Before you make an attack, you can declare you are swinging wild haymakers.

### Moxie Fuelled Fists

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
