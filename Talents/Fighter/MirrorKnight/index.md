### Mirror Image

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 1
You can magically manifest a mirror image of yourself in an unoccupied space that you can see within 15 feet of you. This image is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it (no action required), until you manifest another image, or until you're incapacitated.

Your image has defenses of 20, 1 stamina and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a defense check, it uses your relevant defense bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the image to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your image is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.

You can use the image in the following ways:
- As an action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your image at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.
- One per turn, when you take the Strike action on your turn, any attack that you make with that action can originate from your space or the image's space. You make this choice for each attack.
- The first time each round that a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your image moves at least 5 feet away from your image, the creature must make a defence check to avoid being hit by an attack of opportunity, as if you were in the image's space.

### Unleash Incarnation

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*You can heighten your image's fury.*

You can take the Strike action originating from your image's space twice per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Mirror Avatar

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Mirror Image and 4 other Fighter Talents<br>**Actions:** 1
*You can temporarily transfer your consciousness to your mirror image.*

You can see through your image's eyes and hear through its ears. During this time, you are deafened and blinded. You can sustain this effect for up to 10 minutes, and you can end it at any time (no action required). While your image is being used in this way, it can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without being destroyed.

### Glass Martyr

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Mirror Avatar and 6 other Fighter Talents
You can make your echo throw itself in front of an attack directed at another creature that you can see. The first time each round that an allied creature that you can see is hit with an attack, your image takes the damage instead. Your image teleports to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the targeted creature. The triggering attack is instead made against your image.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Reclaim Potential

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 65 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Glass Martyr and 9 other Fighter Talents
*You've learned to absorb the fleeting magic of your image.*

When an image of yours is destroyed by taking damage, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Legion of One

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Reclaim Potential and 11 other Fighter Talents<br>**Actions:** 1
You can use 1 action to create two images with your Mirror Image feature, and these images can coexist. If you try to create a third image, the previous two images are destroyed. Anything you can do from one image's position can be done from the other's instead.

In addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Unleash Incarnation feature left, you regain one use of that feature.
