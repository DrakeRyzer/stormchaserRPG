# Cavalier
The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.

## Branch Features
You gain the following features when taking your first talent in this branch.

#### Bonus Proficiency
You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: animal handling, history, insight, performance, or persuasion. Alternatively, you learn two languages of your choice.

#### Born to the Saddle
Your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have +1d on checks made to avoid falling off of your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you're not incapacitated.

Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

### Unwavering Mark

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.

While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has -1d on any attack roll that doesn't target you.

In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack's weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to your total fighter talents.

Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Warding Maneuver

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Unwavering Mark and 4 other Fighter Talents
You learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, and you're wielding a weapon or a shield, you can roll your martial feat die. Add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Hold the Line

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Warding Maneuver and 6 other Fighter Talents
You become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures now provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if a creature is hit with an opportunity attack from you, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

### Ferocious Charger

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 65 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Hold the Line and 9 other Fighter Talents
You can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, if your attack roll exceeds the target's Strength defence, it is knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

### Vigilant Defender

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ferocious Charger and 11 other Fighter Talents
You respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you now make one opportunity attack on every creature's turn, except your turn, rather than once per round.
