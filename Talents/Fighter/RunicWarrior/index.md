# Runic Warrior
Runic Warriors enhance their martial prowess using the ancient supernatural power of runes. Rune cutters can be found among any family of giants, and you likely learned your methods first or second hand from such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the giant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower your equipment.

## Branch Features
You gain the following features when taking your first Talent in this Branch.

### Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency with smith's tools, and you learn to speak, read, and write Giant.

### Rune Carver

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You learn two runes of your choice from among the runes described below. Each time that you take a fighter talent, you can replace one rune you know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain talents in this class, you learn additional runes.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know and inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else that you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.

The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune requires a creature to make a defence check on its turn, your Rune Magic defence DC equals 10 + your Constitution modifier.

#### Cloud Rune
*This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants.*

While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have +1d on Deception and Sleight of Hand checks.

In addition, the first time each round that you or an allied creature that you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you invoke the rune and the attacker must choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than itself, as long as they are within range of the attack. On your turn you can designate which creatures can be targeted by this effect. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. 

Once this rune is invoked, it can't be again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Fire Rune
*This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great fire giant smiths.*

While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have expertise on any check that you make using a tool with which you are trained.

In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles. The target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and, if the attack roll exceeds its Strength defence, it is restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the defence check at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. 

Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Frost Rune
*This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants.*

While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you benefit from +1d on Animal Handling and Intimidation checks.

In addition, you can invoke the rune using 1 action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +1d bonus to all checks that use Strength or Constitution.

Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Hill Rune
*This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant.*

While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have +1d on defence checks vs poison and resistance to poison damage.

In addition, you can invoke the rune using 1 action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. 

Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Stone Rune
*This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants.*

While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you benefit from +1d on Insight checks and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

In addition, once per round, the first time that a creature that you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, the rune is invoked and the creature must make a Wisdom defence check. On your turn, you can designate which creatures can be targeted by this effect. On a hit, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the defence at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. 

Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Storm Rune
*Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer.*

While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you benefit from +1d on Arcana checks and you can't be surprised as long as you aren't incapacitated.

In addition, you can invoke the rune using 1 action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, the first time that you or another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, defence check, or skill check, a friendly creature benefits from +1d to the roll and a hostile creature suffers -1d. On your turn you can designate which creatures can be targeted by this effect.

Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
