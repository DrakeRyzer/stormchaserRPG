*You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon.*

- You can use that weapon as a spellcasting focus for your spells.
- You can’t be disarmed of that weapon while you are conscious.
- If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon on your turn (no action required), causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.

You can have up to two bonded weapons and can summon both at the same time using 1 action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, then you must break the bond with one of the other two.
