# Charm
While charm bards may pick up more traditional arts, like music or painting, they excel the most in the art of conversation and captivation. Charm bards spend their studies learning how read people, and how to please them. As such, most charm bards know a little of everything, the better to entertain a wide variety of peoples and personalities. Some use their abilities for good, bringing catharsis to anyone who gives them a chance, while others use it for their own nefarious purposes; others still simply use it as a means to an end, putting their skills to use in fields where it will earn them some coin. Charm bards are taught unique ways to bolster their party's spirits, and demoralise their enemies, above and beyond what most other colleges teach.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you take your first talent from the College of Charm, you gain proficiency in Deception, Insight and Persuasion. If you are already proficient in these skills, then their character point value is refunded to you to spend elsewhere.

### Bonus Equipment
You have in your possession one or more trinkets from people with whom you shared a close relationship in the past. It could be a parent, relative, lover, friend, mentor, or anyone who had a strong emotional impact on your life. You use this as your focus for spellcasting.

Work with your GM to determine an appropriate item or items to keep on your person. If your trinket is lost, and you do not have a replacement, you will not be able to cast spells until your are able to find a new one with enough sentimental value, at your GM's discretion.

### Commanding Adoration

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
It pains your opponents to fight you and your allies.

As a bonus action, you exude an aura that commands adoration from those around you. For 1 minute or until you are incapacitated, any creature hostile to you that ends their turn within 30ft of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d4 psychic damage. This damage increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level and 1d12 at 17th level. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, with a minimum of 1. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Aura of Good Will

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Bardic Inspirastion, Commanding Adoration and 2 other Bard Talents
Your silken words and welcoming body language give others cause to trust you

As a free action, you can expend 1 use of your Bardic Inspiration to attempt to enamor your target. Make a performance check vs the target's wisdom defence. On a hit, the target is charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target becomes enamored with you, and becomes defensive against any creature that threatens you. This ability cannot force another creature to fight, unless they would otherwise be inclined to do so. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.

If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.

### Charismatic Resolve

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Aura of Good Will and 7 Bard Talents
Your presence alone gives your companions encouragement.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend a Bardic Inspiration on any enemy you can see within 60 ft. Until your next turn, your companions gain +1d on skill checks and attacks made against this enemy. Once you have used this ability on an enemy, it cannot be used on that enemy again for 24 hours.
