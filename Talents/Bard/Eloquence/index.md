# Eloquence
Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art of oratory. Persuasion is regarded as a high art, and a well-reasoned, well-spoken argument often proves more persuasive than facts. These bards wield a blend of logic and theatrical wordplay, winning over skeptics and detractors with logical arguments and plucking at heartstrings to appeal to the emotions of audiences.

### Silver Tongue

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 2 Character Points
You are a master at saying the right thing at the right time. When you make a deception or persuasion check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Unsettling Words

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 3 Character Points
You can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As an action, you can expend one use of your bardic inspiration and choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. The next attack roll made agains the creature before the start of your next turn gains +1d.

### Unfailing Inspiration

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Silver Tongue and 4 Other Bard Talents
Your inspiring words are so persuasive that others feel driven to succeed. When a creature uses one of your bardic inspiration dice and the roll fails, the creature can keep the bardic inspiration die.

### Universal Speech

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Unsettling Words and 7 other Bard Talents
You have gained the ability to make your speech intelligible to any creature. As an action, choose one or more creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). For the next hour, the chosen creatures can magically understand you, regardless of the language that you speak.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Infectious Inspiration

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Unfailing Inspiration, Universal Speech and 10 other Bard Talents
When you successfully inspire someone, the power of your eloquence can now spread to someone else. Once per round, when a creature within 60 feet of you uses one of your bardic inspiration and the roll succeeds, a different creature (other than yourself) that can hear you within 60 feet of you can receive a bardic inspiration die without expending any of your bardic inspiration uses.

You can use this talent a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
