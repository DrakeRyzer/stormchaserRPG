# Whispers
Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Whisper bards use this to their advantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the way of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.

Many other bards hate their whisper peers, viewing them as parasites that use a bard’s reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this teaching rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other affiliation, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.

### Psychic Blades
You gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature’s mind. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can spend a use of your bardic inspiration to deal an additionaL 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.

### Words of Terror
You learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror. If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, make a proficient Charisma attack against the target's Wisdom defense. On a hit, the target is now [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) of you or another creature of your choice. The target is [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.

If the attack misses, then the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Improved Psychic Blades
*Prerequisite:* Psychic Blades and 2 Other Bard Talents
The bonus damage that you inflict with Psychic Blades increases to 3d6.

### Mantle of Whispers
*Prerequisite:* Words of Terror and 3 Other Bard Talents
You gain the ability to adopt a humanoid’s persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you magically capture its shadow. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.

You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.

While you’re in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn’t include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.

Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on an [insight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Insight/) check against your passive deception. Your passive deception gains +1d for this check.

Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can’t capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.

### Improved Psychic Blades II
*Prerequisite:* Improved Psychic Blades and 6 Other Bard Talents
The bonus damage that you inflict with Psychic Blades increases to 5d6.

### Shadow Lore
*Prerequisite:* Mantle of Whispers and 9 Other Bard Talents
You gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears. As an action, you make a proficient Charisma attack to magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. This attack automatically misses if it doesn’t share a language with you or if the target can’t hear you. On a miss, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.

On a hit, the target is [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack or damage it. The target interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.

The [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.

When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Improved Psychic Blades III
*Prerequisite:* Psychic Blades II and 10 Other Bard Talents
The bonus damage that you inflict with Psychic Blades increases to 8d6.
