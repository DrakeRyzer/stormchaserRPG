# Spirits
Spirit Bards seek tales with inherent power — be they legends, histories, or fictions — and bring their subjects to life. Using occult trappings, these bards conjure spiritual embodiments of powerful forces to change the world once more. Such spirits are capricious, though, and what a bard summons isn’t always entirely under their control.

## Branch Feature

### Spiritual Focus
You employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes. You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your spells: a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarokka deck.

### Guiding Whispers
You can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the *[guidance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Divination/#guidance)* cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of cantrips that you know. Its range becomes 60 feet when you cast it.

### Tales From Beyond
You reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your spiritual focus, you can use a bonus action to roll a bardic inspiration die and use the table below to determine the tale that the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale’s effect or you finish a short or long rest.

You can use an action to choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale’s effect. Once you do so, you can’t bestow the tale’s effect again until you roll it again.

You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time. Rolling on the table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale. If the tale requires an attack roll, make a Charisma attack roll with proficiency.

### Spirit Session
*Prerequisites:* Tales From Beyond and 3 Other Bard Talents<br>
Spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a short or long rest) using your spiritual focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.

The spell that you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must be of a level that you can cast and it must be in the school of divination or necromancy. The chosen spell doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.

Once you perform the ritual, you can’t do so again until you start a long rest. You know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.

Additionally, when you cast a bard spell that deals damage or restores hit points through the spiritual focus, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus to one damage or healing roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.

### Mystical Connection
*Prerequisites:* Spirit Session and 9 Other Bard Talents<br>
You now have the ability to nudge the spirits of Tales from Beyond toward certain tales. Whenever you roll on the Spirit Tales table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to bestow. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.

> ### Spirit Tales
> Storytellers, like spirit bards, often give voice to tales inspired by some greater theme or body of work. When determining what stories you tell, consider what unites them. Do they all feature characters from a specific group, like archetypes from the tarokka deck, figures from constellations, childhood imaginary friends, or characters in a particular storybook? Or are your inspirations more general, incorporating historic champions, mythological heroes, or urban legends? Use the tales you tell to define your niche as a storytelling adventurer.
