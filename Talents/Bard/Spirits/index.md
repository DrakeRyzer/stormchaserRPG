# Spirits
Spirit Bards seek tales with inherent power — be they legends, histories, or fictions — and bring their subjects to life. Using occult trappings, these bards conjure spiritual embodiments of powerful forces to change the world once more. Such spirits are capricious, though, and what a bard summons isn’t always entirely under their control.

## Branch Feature

### Spiritual Focus
You employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes. You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your spells: a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarokka deck.

### Guiding Whispers
You can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the *[guidance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Divination/#guidance)* cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of cantrips that you know. Its range becomes 60 feet when you cast it.

### Tales From Beyond

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points
You reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your spiritual focus, you can use a bonus action to to expend one use of your bardic inspiration roll on the table below, using your martial feat die to determine the tale that the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale’s effect or you finish a short or long rest.

You can use an action to choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale’s effect. Once you do so, you can’t bestow the tale’s effect again until you roll it again.

You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time. Rolling on the table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale. If the tale requires an attack roll, make a performance check.

| 2 | **Tale of the Renowned Duelist.** You make a performance check and treat the result as a melee attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes energy damage equal to two rolls of your martial feat die + your Charisma modifier. |

| 5 | **Tale of the Avenger.** For 1 minute, any creature that hits the target with a melee attack takes force damage equal to a roll of your martial feat die. |
| 6 | **Tale of the Traveler.** The target gains temporary stamina equal to a roll of its recovery die + your Charisma modifier. While it has this temporary stamina, the target’s walking speed increases by 10 feet and it gains +1d to its defenses vs melee and ranged attacks. |
| 7 | **Tale of the Beguiler.** Make a performance check vs the target's Wisdom defense.

If the target hits a creature with an attack during this invisibility, the creature that it hit takes profane damage equal to a roll of your martial feat die and is [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) of the target until the end of the [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) creature’s next turn. |
| 9 | **Tale of the Brute.** Make a performance check vs Strength defense of each creature of the target's choice that it can see within 30 feet.

### Spirit Session

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Tales From Beyond and 4 other Bard Talents
Spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a short or long rest) using your spiritual focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.

The spell that you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less and it must be in the school of divination or necromancy.

Once you perform the ritual, you can’t do so again until you start a long rest. You know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.

Additionally, when you cast a spell through your spiritual focus that deals damage or restores stamina, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus to one damage or healing roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.

### Mystical Connection

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You now have the ability to nudge the spirits of Tales from Beyond toward certain tales.

If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.
