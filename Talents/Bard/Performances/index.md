# Bardic Performances
Any bard who meets a performance's prerequisites can select and use a bardic performance.

## Bardic Inspiration
*You can inspire others through stirring words or music.*

To do so, choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d20.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die as +1d on one ability check, attack roll, or defence check it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the original die before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

## Compulsion

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Dissonant Whispers
*Your words cut deep into the hearts of the bold, exposing a gap in the armour of their courage.*

Choose a number of targets up to your Charisma modifier. A target is unaffected if it can't be charmed. Make a Performance check against the target's Wisdom defense. Until the Performance ends, you can use one action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Stride/) in that direction on its next turn. It can use other actions before it moves. After moving in this way, it can a Wisdom check against your Charisma defense to try to end the effect. 

A target isn't compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.

## Countersong
*You gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects.*

You can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have +1d to your defences vs being [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) or [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/). A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are [Incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/) or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

## Cutting Words

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points
*You learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others.*

Once per round, you may choose a target within 60 feet that you can see. The target's next attack roll, skill check, or defence check suffers -1d. The target is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.

## Deadly Performance

On a hit, you deal 3d6 psychic damage and the target immediately moves away from you as far as possible, up to its movement speed.

## Fascinate
*You use your performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with you.*

Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear you, and capable of paying attention to you. You bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. You can target a number of creature's equal to your Charisma modifier with this ability.

On a miss, you cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. On a hit, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as you continue to maintain it. While fascinated, a target has –1d penalty on skill checks, such as Perception checks.

Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a Wisdom defence check against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.
