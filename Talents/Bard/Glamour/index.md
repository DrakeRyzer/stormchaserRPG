# Glamour
Glamour bards have mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Hedge or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, fey elves and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.

Glamour bards are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous glamour bards can leech off a community for weeks, misusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic glamour bards instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.
