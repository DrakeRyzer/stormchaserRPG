# Glamour
The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.

The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, misusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.

### Mantle of Inspiration
As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of creatures you can see and that can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary Stamina. When a creature gains this temporary Stamina, it can immediately move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Enthralling Performance
If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Make a CHA check against their WIS Defense. Success puts the target under the [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) condition towards you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.

If you fail to charm a target with this talent, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Mantle of Inspiration II
Temporary Stamina granted through your Mantle of Inspiration ability increases to 8.

### Mantle of Majesty
You gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast [*Command*]**(Link needed)**, without expending mana, and you take on an appearance of unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast [*Command*]**(Link needed)** as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending mana.

If you cast [*Command*]**(Link needed)** using this talent against a creature already [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) by you, your spell attack roll automatically succeeds.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Mantle of Inspiration III
Temporary Stamina granted through your Mantle of Inspiration ability increases to 11.

### Unbreakable Majesty
Your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce.

In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are [Incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/). For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma Defense check. On a failed check, it can’t attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful check, it can attack you on this turn, but it has -4 to all defenses against your spells on your next turn.

Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Mantle of Inspiration IV
Temporary Stamina granted through your Mantle of Inspiration ability increases to 14.
