# Glamour
Glamour bards have mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Hedge or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, fey elves and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.

Glamour bards are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous glamour bards can leech off a community for weeks, misusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic glamour bards instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.

### Mantle of Inspiration
You have the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigour and speed.

As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your bardic inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of creatures that you can see and that can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary stamina. At the start of the creature's next turn it can immediately move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Enthralling Performance
You can charge your performance with seductive, fey magic.

If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Make a proficient Charisma attack vs the Wisdom defense of each target. On a hit, the target is [charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/). While [charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) in this way, the target idolizes you, speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it and hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.

On a miss, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Mantle of Inspiration II
*Prerequisite:* Mantle of Inspiration and 2 Other Bard Talents<br>
The amount of temporary stamina granted by Mantle of Inspiration increases to 8.

### Mantle of Majesty
*Prerequisite:* Enthralling Performance and 3 Other Bard Talents<br>
You gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast [Command]() without expending mana. You take on an appearance of unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast [command]() as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending mana.

Any creature [charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) by you is automatically hit by the [Command]() that you cast with this talent.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Mantle of Inspiration III
*Prerequisite:* Mantle of Inspiration II and 6 Other Bard Talents<br>
The amount of temporary stamina granted by Mantle of Inspiration increases to 11.

### Unbreakable Majesty
*Prerequisite:* Mantle of Majesty and 9 Other Bard Talents<br>
Your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce.

In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/). For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma defense check with a DC equal to your Charisma defence. On a failed check, it can’t attack you on this turn and it must choose a new target for its attack, or the attack is wasted. On a successful check, it can attack you on this turn, you have advantage to hit it on your next turn.

Once you assume this majestic presence, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Mantle of Inspiration IV
*Prerequisite:* Mantle of Inspiration III and 10 Other Bard Talents<br>
The amount of temporary stamina granted by Mantle of Inspiration increases to 14.
