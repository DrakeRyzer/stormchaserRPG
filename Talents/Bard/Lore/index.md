# Lore
Lore Bards know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.

The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than political.

Lore Bards gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

## Branch Feature

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you take your first Lore branch talent, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

## Talents

| Talent | CP | Prerequisites | Other Bard Talents Required |
|:------:|:--:|:-------------:|:---------------------------:|
| Cutting Words | 14 | - | - |
| Clandestine Keeper | 12 | Jack of All Trades, Cutting Words | 3 |
| Peerless Skill | 12 | Clandestine Keeper | 8 |

### Cutting Words
You learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. Choose a target within 60 feet that you can see then roll a bardic inspiration die. On the target's next attack roll, ability check, or damage roll,  reduce it my the amount rolled on your bardic inspriation die. If the subtraction would have no effect on the result, the effect is instead saved until the next applicable roll. The target is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.

### Clandestine Keeper
You learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.

### Peerless Skill
When you make an ability check, you can roll a bardic inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.
