# Valour
Bards of valour are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesnâ€™t pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.

### Blade Flourish

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Bardic Inspiration
*You learn to perform impressive displays of martial prowess and speed that inspire others in battle.*

Whenever you take the Strike action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn. If a weapon attack that you make as part of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the following blade flourish options of your choice. You can use only one blade flourish option once per turn.

**Defensive Flourish.** You can expend one use of your bardic inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage equal to your martial feat die to the target that you hit. You may also add +1d to your strength or dexterity defense until the start of your next turn.

**Slashing Flourish.** You can expend one use of your bardic inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage equal to your martial feat die to the target that you hit and to any other creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you.

**Mobile Flourish.** You can expend one use of your bardic inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage equal to your martial feat die to the target that you hit. You can also push the target up to 5 feet away from you, plus a number of feet equal to the number you roll on that die. You can then immediately use your reaction to move up to your walking speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.

Additionally, a creature benefitting from your bardic inspiration can instead roll your martial feat die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll that it just made. If a creature has a bardic inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores stamina or deals damage, then that creature can instead roll your martial feat die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the stamina regained or the damage dealt.
