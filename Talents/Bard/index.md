# Bard Talent Tree
Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to discover them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 1 per round<br>**Prerequisite:** Trained in [Performance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Performance/)
Your training in [performance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Performance/) can be used to manipulate those around you. Choose one of the the following Bardic Performances: [Bardic Inspiration](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Bard/Performances/#bardic-inspiration), [Countersong](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Bard/Performances/#countersong), [Fascinate](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Bard/Performances/#fascinate) and [Song of Rest](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Bard/Performances/#song-of-rest). You know this bardic performance and may purchase additional options with character points.

Starting a Bardic Performance is an action and must be maintained each round as an action. Changing a Bardic Performance from one effect to another requires you to stop the previous performance as a free action and start a new one as an action. A Bardic Performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralysed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking an action to maintain it each round.

Each Bardic Performance has audible components, visual components, or both.

If a Bardic Performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances are language dependent (as noted in the description). A deaf bard suffers -1d to their [performance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Performance/) check when attempting to use a Bardic Performance with an audible component. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.

If a Bardic Performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A blind bard takes a -2d penalty to their [performance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Performance/) check when attempting to use a Bardic Performance with a visual component. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.
