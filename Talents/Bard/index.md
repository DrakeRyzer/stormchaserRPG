# Bard Talent Tree (Expert)
Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to discover them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.

### Bardic Performance

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points

#### Bardic Inspiration
*You can inspire others through stirring words or music.*

To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d20.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die as an instance of advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or defence check it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the original die before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalise your wounded allies during a short rest. At the end of the short rest, you and any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain stamina equal to the result of one Hit Die plus their Constitution modifier.

#### Countersong
*You gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects.*

As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have +1d to your defences vs being [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) or [charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/). A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/) or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

### Jack of All Trades

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You may reroll any ability check that you make that does not benefit from proficiency, but you must take the result.

### Cutting Words

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*You learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others.*

Once per round, you may choose a target within 60 feet that you can see. The target's next attack roll, skill check, or defence check suffers -1d. This consumes 1 use of your Bardic Inspiration. The target is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.

### Peerless Skill

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Jack of all Trades and 7 Other Bard Talents
When you make a skill check, you can spend a use of your bardic inspiration die to roll with +1d. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the skill check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

### Virtuoso

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 100 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 14 Other Bard Talents
*You are the epitome of music and magic.*

Your Dexterity and Charisma scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores also increases by 2. Additionally, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain a number of uses equal to your Charisma modifier.
