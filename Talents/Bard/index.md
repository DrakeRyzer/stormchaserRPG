# Bard Talent Tree ([Expert](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Expert/))
Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to discover them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.

### Bardic Performance

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 1
You are trained to use the [Performance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Performance/) skill to manipulate those around you.

Starting a Bardic Performance is an action and must be maintained each round as an action. Changing a Bardic Performance from one effect to another requires you to stop the previous performance and start a new one as an action. A Bardic Performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralysed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking an action to maintain it each round.

Each Bardic Performance has audible components, visual components, or both.

If a Bardic Performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances are language dependent (as noted in the description). A deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a Bardic Performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.

If a Bardic Performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a Bardic Performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Bardic Performance: Bardic Inspiration
*You can inspire others through stirring words or music.*

To do so, choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d20.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die as +1d on one ability check, attack roll, or defence check it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the original die before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Additionally, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalise your wounded allies during a short rest. At the end of the short rest, you and any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain stamina equal to the result of one Hit Die plus their Constitution modifier.

#### Bardic Performance: Countersong
*You gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects.*

You can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have +1d to your defences vs being [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) or [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/). A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are [Incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/) or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

#### Bardic Performance: Fascinate
*You use your performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with you.*

Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear you, and capable of paying attention to you. You bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. You can target a number of creature's equal to your Charisma modifier with this ability.

Make a [Performance](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Performance/) check vs the Wisdom defence of each creatrue targetted. On a miss, you cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. On a hit, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as you continue to maintain it. While fascinated, a target has –1d penalty on skill checks, such as Perception checks.

Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a Wisdom defence check against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is a mind-affecting charm and relies on audible and visual components in order to function.
