# The Djinn
You have made a pact with one of the djinn. Such entities rule vast fiefs on the elemental planes and have great influence over elemental creatures. Djinn are varied in their motivations, but most are arrogant and wield power that rivals that of lesser deities. They delight in turning the table on mortals, who often bind djinn into servitude and readily enter into pacts that expand their reach.

### Djinn Affinity
Choose your patron’s affinity or determine it randomly, using the following table:

| d4 | Element |
|:--:|:-------:|
| 1 | Fire |
| 2 | Earth |
| 3 | Air |
| 4 | Water |

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
Once you can cast spells of that level, you gain the below djinn spells as bonus spells, along with the spells associated with your patron’s affinity. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always know it and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.

If you have a bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the arcane spell list, that spell is nevertheless an arcane spell for you.

###  Djinn's Vessel

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*Your patron gifts you a magical vessel that grants you a safe resting place and a measure of the djinn’s power.*

The vessel is a tiny object and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your arcane spells. You decide what the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Genie’s Vessel table.

#### Djinn’s Vessel
| d6 | Vessel |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | Oil Lamp |
| 2 | Urn |
| 3 | Ring with a compartment |
| 4 | Stoppered bottle |
| 5 | Hollow statuette |
| 6 | Ornate lantern |

While you are touching the vessel, you can use it in the following ways:

**Bottled Respite:** Using 2 actions, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space that you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot radius, 20-foot high cylinder and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel, as though you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel for a number of hours up to twice your maximum spell level. You exit the vessel early if you use 1 action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out. If the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel’s former space. Once you enter the vessel, you cannot enter it again until you finish a long rest.

**Djinn’s Wrath:** Once during each of your turns, when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. The type of this damage is determined by your patron's affinity: corrosive (earth), sonic (air), fire (fire), or cold (water).

The vessel’s defence is equal to your spellcasting attribute. The vessel's Stamina is equal to twice your maximum spell level plus your spellcasting attribute modifier. The vessel is immune to poison and psychic damage.

If the vessel is destroyed, or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.

### Elemental Gift

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Djinn's Vessel
*You begin to take on characteristics of your patron.*

You now have resistance to a damage type determined by your patron’s kind: corrosive (earth), sonic (air), fire (fire), or cold (water).

Using 1 Action, you can give yourself a flying speed equal to your movement speed that lasts for 10 minutes, during which you can hover. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

###  Sanctuary Vessel
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Elemental Gift
*You can welcome others into the safety of your vessel.*

When you enter your djinn’s Vessel via the Bottled Respite feature, you can now choose up to five willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you, and the chosen creatures are drawn into the vessel with you.

Using 1 action, you can eject any number of creatures from the vessel and everyone is ejected if you leave or die, or if the vessel is destroyed. In addition, anyone (including you) who remains within the vessel for at least 10 minutes gains the benefit of completing a short rest and anyone can add your spellcasting attribute modifier to the amount of Stamina that they regain if they spend any recovery dice as part of a short rest there.

### Limited Wish

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Sanctuary Vessel<br>**Actions:** 2
*You entreat your patron to grant you a small wish.*

You can speak your desire to your djinn’s Vessel, requesting the effect of one spell that is 6th level or lower. The spell can be from any spell list and you don’t need to meet the requirements in that spell, including costly components; the spell simply takes effect as part of this action.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish 1d4 long rests.
