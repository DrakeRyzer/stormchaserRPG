# The Archfey
Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being’s motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.

###  Fey Presence

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 2
*Your patron bestows upon you the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey.*

Make a spell attack roll vs the Wisdom defense of creatures of your choice in a 10-foot cube originating from you. For all creatures that you hit, they are either [charmed]() or [frightened]() (your choice) by you until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Misty Escape

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Fey Presence<br>**Action:** Free<br>**Trigger:** You take damage.
*You vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm.*

You turn [invisible]() and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain [invisible]() until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

This ability triggers the first instance of you taking damage, unless you declare on your turn or when you roll initiative that it will trigger upon a specific instance, or not to use it at all. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

###  Beguiling Defenses
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Misty Escape<br>**Actions:** Free<br>**Trigger:** A creature attempts to charm you.
*Your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them.*

You are immune to being [charmed]().

When another creature attempts to charm you, the creature must make a Wisdom defense check vs your spellcasting skill. On a fail, it is [charmed]() by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

This ability triggers once per round and automatically on the first attempt of another creature attempting to charm you each round, unless you declare on your turn or when you roll initiative that it will trigger from attempts to charm you by a specified creature, or not to use it at all.


### Dark Delirium

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Beguiling Defenses<br>**Actions:** 2
*You plunge a creature into an illusory realm.*

Choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you and make a spell attack vs its Wisdom defense. On a hit, it is [charmed]() or [frightened]() by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.

Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.

You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.
