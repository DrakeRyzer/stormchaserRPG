# The Undying
Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life, although, like all power, such a prize comes at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the seasons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
You learn the [Spare the Dying](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Restoration/#spare-the-dying) cantrip, which is an arcane cantrip for you and does not count against your total number of cantrips.

You gain the following bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always know it and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.

If you have a bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the arcane spell list, that spell is nevertheless an arcane spell for you.

###  Among the Dead

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*Being on the edge of death, it’s difficult for the undead to determine if you stand with them.*

You gain +1d to your defenses vs disease.

Additionally, the undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead creature targets you directly with an attack, that creature must make a Wisdom defense check vs your spellcasting skill (an undead needn't make the check when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). If the undead creature fails, then it must choose a new target or forfeit the attack, potentially wasting it. On a successful check, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead creature is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack.

### Defy Death

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Among the Dead
*You can give yourself vitality when you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it.*

when you succeed on a recovery check or when you stabilise a creature with [Spare the Dying](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Restoration/#spare-the-dying), you can regain Stamina equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier.

###  Undying Nature

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Defy Death
*You have one foot in the grave!*

You can hold your breath indefinitely and you don’t require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests.

In addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year and you are immune to being magically aged.

### Indestructible Life

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Undying Nature<br>**Actions:** 1

You can regain Stamina equal to 1d8 + twice your maximum spell level. Additionally, if you put a severed body part of yours back in place when you use this feature, the part reattaches.
