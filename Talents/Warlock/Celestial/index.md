# The Celestial
Your patron is a powerful being of the higher planes. You have bound yourself to an ancient empyrean, solar, ki-rin, unicorn, or other entity that resides in the planes of everlasting bliss. Your pact with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse.

Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, and a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days. But you know that your mission is among mortals for now, and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world.

You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals two times your maximum spell level.

You can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your spellcasting attribute bonus (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of stamina equal to the total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes sacred damage equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and it is [blinded]() until the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
