# The Fathomless
You have plunged into a pact with the depths. An entity of the ocean, the elemental plane of water, or another otherworldly sea now allows you to draw on its thalassic power. Is it merely using you to learn about terrestrial realms, or does it want you to open cosmic floodgates and drown the world?

Perhaps you were born into a generational cult that venerates the fathomless and its spawn, or you might have been shipwrecked and on the brink of drowning when your patron’s grasp offered you a chance at life. Whatever the reason for your pact, the sea and its unknown depths call to you.

Entities of the deep that might empower a warlock include krakens, ancient water elementals, godlike hallucinations dreamed into being by kuo-toa, merfolk demigods and sea hag covens.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
You learn the [Eldritch Blast](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Cantrips/Evocation/#eldritch-blast) cantrip. It does not count against the number of arcane cantrips that you know. When you learn this spell, choose the type of damage it will do: cold, electric or sonic.

You gain the following bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a bonus spell, you always know it and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know.

If you have a bonus spell that doesn’t appear on the arcane spell list, that spell is nevertheless an arcane spell for you.

###  Tentacle of the Deep I

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 1
*You summon a spectral tentacle that strikes at your foes.*

You create a 10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The tentacle lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature to create another tentacle. When you create the tentacle, you can make a melee spell attack against one creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

On subsequent turns, using 1 Action, you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack. You can summon the tentacle a number of times equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

###  Gift of the Sea

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You can swim a distance equal to your speed, and you can breathe underwater.

### Oceanic Soul

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:**  3rd Level Spells and Gift of the Sea
*You are now even more at home in the depths.*

You gain resistance to cold damage. In addition, when you are fully submerged, any creature that is also fully submerged can understand your speech and you can understand theirs.

### Guardian Coil I

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:**  3rd Level Spells and Tentacle of the Deep I<br>**Actions:** Free<br>**Trigger:** A creature you see takes damage within 10 feet of the tentacle.
*The tentacle you summon can defend you and others.*

You can choose one creature damaged within the range of your tentacle and reduce the damage to that creature by 1d8.

This ability automatically triggers once per round the first time that a creature within the range of your tentacle takes damage, with the following exceptions: on your turn, or when you roll initiative, you may declare that your Guardian Coil only be triggered when a specific creature takes damage, or not to use it at all.

###  Grasping Tentacles
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Guardian Coil I
You learn the spell [Black Tentacles](). It counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you know. You can also cast it once expending mana and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you cast this spell, your patron’s magic bolsters you, granting you an amount of temporary Stamina equal to twice your maximum spell level. Moreover, damage can’t break your concentration on this spell.

###  Tentacle of the Deep II

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells, Oceanic Soul and Guardian Coil I
Attacks made by your tentacle now do 2d8 cold damage.

*You magically open temporary conduits to watery destinations.*

You can teleport yourself and up to five other willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you. Amid a whirl of tentacles, you all vanish and then reappear up to 1 mile away in a body of water that you’ve seen (pond size or larger), or within 30 feet of it, each of you appearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the others.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
