# The Great Old One
Your patron is a mysterious entity who's nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from the a distant realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals and its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be unaware of your existence or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets that you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it.

###  Awakened Mind

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*Your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures.*

You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

### Entropic Ward

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Awakened Mind<br>**Actions:** Free<br>**Trigger:** A creature makes a melee or ranged attack roll against you.
*You learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy’s failed strike into good luck for yourself.*

When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can add +1d to your defence. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature gains +1d, if you make it before the end of your next turn.

This ability automatically triggers the first time that you are the target of a melee or ranged attack, with the following exceptions: on your turn, or when you roll initiative, you may you declare that your Entropic Ward will only be triggered when a specific creature targets you with an attack, or not to use it at all.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

###  Thought Shield

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Entropic Ward
*Your patron causes your mind to appear muddied to others.*

Your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy, or other means, unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage and, whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.

### Create Thrall

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Thought Shield<br>**Actions:** 2
*You gain the ability to infect a humanoid’s mind with the alien magic of your patron.*

You touch an [Incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/) humanoid, that then becomes [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) by you until a [Remove Curse]() spell is cast on it, the [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) condition is removed from it, or you use this ability again.

You can communicate telepathically with the [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) creature, as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
