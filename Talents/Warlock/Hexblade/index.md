# The Hexblade
You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from Annwn — a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in this shadowy realm. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.

Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.

###  Hex Warrior

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
*The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon… You gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone.*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon’s type.

**Hexblade’s Curse:** Using 1 Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals one-half your maximum spell level (rounded up).
* Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
* If the cursed target dies, you regain stamina equal to twice your maximum spell level + your spellcasting attribute modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Accursed Specter

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Hex Warrior
*You can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service.*

When you bring a humanoid to 0 stamina, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a [specter](), the statistics for which are in the Bestiary. When the specter appears, it gains temporary stamina equal to your maximum spell level. The specter shares your same initiative count, but acts directly after you. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier (minimum of +0).

The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can’t use the feature again until you finish a long rest.

###  Armor of Hexes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Accursed Specter<br>**Action:** Free<br>**Trigger:** A creature cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll.
*Your hex grows more powerful.*

If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can cause the creature to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

This ability triggers once per round and on the first instance of a cursed creature hitting you, unless you declare on your turn or when you roll initiative that it will trigger upon a specific instance, or not to use it at all.

### Master of Hexes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Armor of Hexes<br>**Actions:** Free<br>**Trigger:** A creature cursed by Hexblade’s Curse dies.
*You can spread your Hexblade’s Curse from a slain creature to another creature.*

You can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren’t [incapacitated](). When you apply the curse in this way, you don’t regain stamina from the death of the previously cursed creature.

You may declare, at the end of your turn, which creature to apply the curse to should the currently cursed creature die on another creature’s turn. Otherwise, the curse will end.
