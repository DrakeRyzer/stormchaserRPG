# The Archfey
Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being’s motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.

###  Fey Presence

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Actions:** 2
*Your patron bestows upon you the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey.*

Make a spell attack roll vs the Wisdom defense of creatures of your choice in a 10-foot cube originating from you. For all creatures that you hit, they are either [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) or [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) (your choice) by you until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Misty Escape

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 3rd Level Spells and Fey Presence<br>**Action:** Free<br>**Trigger:** You take damage.
*You vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm.*

You turn [Invisible](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Invisible/) and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain [Invisible](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Invisible/) until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

This ability triggers the first time that you take damage, with the following exceptions: on your turn, or when you roll initiative, you may declare a specific trigger for your Misty Escape, or not to use it at all.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

###  Beguiling Defenses
 
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 5th Level Spells and Misty Escape<br>**Actions:** Free<br>**Trigger:** A creature attempts to charm you.
*Your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them.*

You are immune to being [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/).

When another creature attempts to charm you, the creature must make a Wisdom defense check vs your spellcasting skill. On a fail, it is [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) by you for 1 minute, or until the creature takes any damage.

This ability automatically triggers once per round the first time that a creature attempts to charm you, with the following exceptions: on your turn, or when you roll initiative, you may declare that your Beguiling Defences will only be triggered when a specific creature attempts to charm you, or not to use them at all.

### Dark Delirium

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>
 
#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 7th Level Spells and Beguiling Defenses<br>**Actions:** 2
*You plunge a creature into an illusory realm.*

Choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you and make a spell attack vs its Wisdom defense. On a hit, it is [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) or [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) by you (your choice) for 1 minute, or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.

Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks that it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you and the illusion.

You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.
