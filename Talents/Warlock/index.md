# Warlock Talent Tree

## Spell School Proficiencies
If your first talent is a warlock talent, then you are trained in the following spell schools: Conjuration, Charms and three additional schools of your choice.

## Spellcasting
When you take your first warlock talent, your spellcasting class feature for the mage class is affected in the following ways.

### Spellcasting Ability
Choose Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for your arcane spells. You use use your chosen ability whenever an arcane spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use the modifier of your chosen ability when making an attack roll with an arcane spell.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [arcane spell list]().

Each time that you gain the ability to cast spells of a higher spell level, you learn 2 additional arcane spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level that you can cast. For example, when you take the *2nd Level Spells* talent, you learn two new arcane spells of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, whenever you gain a warlock talent, you can choose one of the arcane spells that you know and replace it with another spell from the arcane spell list, which must also be of a level that you can cast.

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 1 Warlock Talent
*In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.*

You gain an [Eldritch Invocation](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Warlock/Invocations/) of your choice. As you gain Character Points, you may purchase additional [Invocations](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Warlock/Invocations/). If an [Eldritch Invocation]((https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Warlock/Invocations/)) has prerequisites, then you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the [Invocation](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Warlock/Invocations/) at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

Additionally, when you gain a new talent in this class or a spellcasting talent, you can choose one of the [Invocations](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Warlock/Invocations/) that you know and replace it with another [Invocation](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Warlock/Invocations/) that you could learn, provided that they share the same Character Point cost. 

### Pact Boon

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Eldritch Invocations
*Your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service.*

You gain one of the following features of your choice.

#### Pact of the Blade
You can use an action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time that you create it (see the [Weapons](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Weapons/) section for weapon options). You gain +1d to hit with this weapon while you wield it. The weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases to be your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

#### Pact of the Chain
You learn the [Find Familiar]() spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [imp](), [pseudodragon](), [quasit](), or [sprite]().

#### Pact of the Talisman
Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails a d20 roll, they can roll an additional d20, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.

If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.

#### Pact of the Tome
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose any three cantrips from the arcane or divine list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the arcan spell list, they are nonetheless arcane spells for you.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.
