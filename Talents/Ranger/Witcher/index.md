#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
Your witcher training grants you the following benefits:
* When wearing chainmail armour, the maximum Dexterity bonus that you may add to your Dexterity defence increases by 1 and you ignore the noisy property.
* Using your knowledge of the hunt to stalk your prey, you can use your Wisdom attribute to make Stealth checks
* When wielding weapons with the versatile property, you can choose to add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to your attack and damage rolls.

### Witcher Alchemy I

You can spend an hour during a long rest or downtime to gather the necessary materials to concoct an acidic solution. You have enough acid for three applications.

As an action, you can apply this acid to a weapon. For for the next minute, the weapon deals additional corrosive damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. If you have successfully identified the target creature's type, then its damage resistance versus attacks laced with your acid is reduced by one step.
