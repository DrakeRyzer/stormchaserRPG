#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
As part of a long rest, you can spend 10 minutes to collect a number of edible, non-poisonous plants or grubs equal to two times your Wisdom modifier. A creature can use 1 action to consume up to 5 plants or grubs, each of which restores 1 Stamina. The plants or grubs spoil if not consumed withing 24 hours of being collected.

## Healing Salves

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
As part of a long rest, you can spend 1 hour to collect natural ingredients and concoct an ointment that speeds healing. This salve is potent for 24 hours and has a number of uses equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier. Using 1 action, you can use the salve to restore 1d4 Stamina to a creature within reach.

## Monster Mimic

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
By imitating how a beast or Favored Enemy sounds, looks and moves, you gain +1d on Depception and Imitation checks made to convince a creature that it is seeing or hearing that beast or Favored Enemy.

## Natural Explorer

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You gain the following benefits:
* You ignore difficult terrain.

In addition, you gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour more:
* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group’s travel.
* Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

## Poisons and Antidotes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
Spending 1 hour and a successful DC 10 Survival check, you forage for poisonous plants in your area. With these plants you can spend 10 minutes as part of a short or long rest to extract 3 doses of liquid poison (when ingested, a creature makes a Constitution defence check vs your Wisdom skill, on a failure it is [Poisoned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Poisoned/) for 1 hour). Alternatively, using the same plants you can spend an hour making 1 dose of [antitoxin](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Gear/Descriptions/#antitoxin).

## Snare

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
Using a 25-foot length of rope, you spend 1 minute to create a snare trap on the ground using other available materials to camoflauge the trap. This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful [Investigation](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Investigation/) check vs your Survial skill to be perceived.

The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell’s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity defence check vs your Survial skill or be hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) there until it is freed. A [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) creature can make a Dexterity defence check vs your Survial skill at the end of each of its turns, free itself from the trap on a success.
