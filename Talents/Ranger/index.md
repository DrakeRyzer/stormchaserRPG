# Ranger Talent Tree
For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game: even fugitives among their own people.

**As long as at least half of your expert talents are from the ranger talent tree, your stamina increases to 4Ã— your Constitution score and your recovery die increases to a d10.**

## Bonus Proficiencies
When you take your first ranger talent, you gain the following bonus proficiencies:
* **Armour:** Medium armour
