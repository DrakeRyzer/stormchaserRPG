# Fey Wanderer
A fey mystique surrounds you, thanks to the boon of an archfey, the shining fruit you ate from a talking tree, the magic spring you swam in, or some other auspicious event. However you acquired your fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer, a ranger who represents both the mortal and the fey realms. As you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.

## Feywild Gifts

The royal courts of the Feywild have blessed you with the assistance of fey beings: you know the [Summon Fey]() spell. It doesn't count against the number of spells you know, and you can cast it without a material component. You can also cast it once without spending mana, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.

You can slip in and out of the Feywild to move in a blink of an eye: you can cast [Misty Step]() without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you cast misty step, you can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of you. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of your destination space.
