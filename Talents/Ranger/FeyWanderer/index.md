# Fey Wanderer
A fey mystique surrounds you, thanks to the boon of an archfey, the shining fruit you ate from a talking tree, the magic spring you swam in, or some other auspicious event. However you acquired your fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer, a ranger who represents both the mortal and the fey realms. As you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.

If successful, the target is [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) or [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) by you (your choice) for 1 minute.
