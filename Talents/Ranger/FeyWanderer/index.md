# Fey Wanderer
A fey mystique surrounds you, thanks to the boon of an archfey, the shining fruit you ate from a talking tree, the magic spring you swam in, or some other auspicious event. However you acquired your fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer, a ranger who represents both the mortal and the fey realms. As you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.

Your fey qualities give you a supernatural charm. As a result, whenever you make a Charisma check, you can instead use your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

In addition, if you or a creature you can see within 120 feet of you resists being being [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) or [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) since your last turn, you can spend 1 action to make a ranged spell attack against the Wisdom defence of a different creature you can see within 120 feet of you. If successful, the target is [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) or [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) by you (your choice) for 1 minute.

It doesn't count against the number of  spells you know, and you can cast it without a material component. You can also cast it once without spending mana, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.
