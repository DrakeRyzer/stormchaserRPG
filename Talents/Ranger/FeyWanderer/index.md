# Fey Wanderer
A fey mystique surrounds you, thanks to the boon of an archfey, the shining fruit you ate from a talking tree, the magic spring you swam in, or some other auspicious event. However you acquired your fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer, a ranger who represents both the mortal and the fey realms. As you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.

You gain +1d on initiative rolls. In addition, any creature that you hit during combat that has not acted yet becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against an affected target gain +1d until the start of your next turn.

### Sudden Strike

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ambush Master and 11 other Rogue Talents
You can strike with deadly speed. If you take the [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action on your turn, your next [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) on the same turn does not suffer from multiple attack penalty. This second attack can benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target more than once in a turn.
