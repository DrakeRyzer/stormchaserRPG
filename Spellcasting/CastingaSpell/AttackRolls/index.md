# Attack Rolls
Many spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack roll is made with proficiency and your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier.

Some spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated (see chapter 9).

Cantrips involving a melee or ranged attack roll add your spellcasting ability modifier to their damage roll, as detailed in the spell description.
