# Duration
A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

## Instantaneous
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

## Concentration
Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

You can concentrate on a maximum number of spells equal to your spell casting ability modifier (minimum of one). Concentrating on a second spell simultaneously imparts a level of exhaustion. While you are concentrating on spellcasting, this level of exhaustion cannot be removed by any means. Concentrating on a third spell simultaneously imparts an additional two levels of exhaustion, for a total of three. Concentrating on a fourth spell simultaneously imparts an additional three levels of exhaustion for a total of six. Deadly exhaustion that is accumulated in this way kills a character only when the last spell that they are concentrating on ends.

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

* **Casting more spells that require concentration than your spell-casting ability modifier.** If you cast a number of spells that require concentration greater than your spell-casting ability modifier, you lose concentration on all spells that you have cast.
* **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on spells, the attacker rolls vs your spellcasting attribute's defence to break your concentration. The attack bonus equals the sum of levels of all spells that you are concentrating on, or half the damage that you take, whichever number is greater. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, the attacker makes a separate attack roll for each source of damage.
* **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on all spells that you have cast if you are incapacitated or if you die.

The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 defence check using your spellcasting attribute to maintain concentration on a spell.
