# Defence Checks
Some spells specify that a target may make a defence check on its turn to shrug off the some or all of the spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the defence check and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals your Dice Pool Score + your spellcasting attribute modifier + other bonuses - penalties.
