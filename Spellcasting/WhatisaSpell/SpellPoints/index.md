# Spell Points
Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, they can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, the mage class's description includes a table showing how many spells of what spell level a character can use, depending how many talents they have, as quantified by a pool of spell points. For example, a mage with 3 talents has fifteen spell points.

The number of spell points that you have available to spend is based on your number of talents as a mage, as shown in the **Spell Points** table. Your number of talents also determines the maximum level of spell slot that you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.

When a character casts a spell, they expend a number of spell points equal to that spell's level. So when the mage from the above example casts *magic missile*, a 1st-level spell, they spend one of their fifteen spell points and have fourteen remaining. You can't reduce your spell point total to less than 0.

Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell points. For example, a warrior who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a mage who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.

## Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a number of points equal to a higher level than the spell's own level, the spell is cast at the higher level, provided that the number of spell points does not exceed the character's maximum spell level. For example, if a 3rd level wizard casts *magic missile* using two spell points, then that magic missile is cast at 2nd level.

Some spells, such as *magic missile* and *cure wounds*, are more powerful when cast at a higher level, as detailed in the spell's description.

## Recovering Spell Points
Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell points (see [the rules on resting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/Resting/)).

When a spellcaster takes a breather or a short rest, they may spend their hit die to recover spell points, instead of using them to recover hit points. A spellcaster who chooses to do this rolls their spell point die and recovers that number of spell points.

> ## Variant: Short Rest Spell Point Recovery
> If you wish to play a mage that normally recovers its spell points on a long rest, but you would prefer to recover your spell points on a short rest, see the **Spell Points for Short Rest Spellcasters** table below. Such classes have roughly one third as many spell points as a full caster, including expected spell point recovery via hit dice. It is expected that characters have two short rests per day.
