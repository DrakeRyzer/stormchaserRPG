# Casting Time
Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, or much more time to cast.

Some spells are triggered by an action or bonus action on your turn. If you have multiple spells active (for example, two spiritual weapons), then a single casting of a spell may only be triggered once per round.

## Bonus Action
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You can use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. Alternatively, you may cast it with your action as normal. This can allow a character to cast two levelled spells on the same turn.

## Longer Casting Times
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes, or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or bonus action, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see "Concentration" below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.
