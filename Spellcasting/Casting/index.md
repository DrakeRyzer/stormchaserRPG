# Casting a Spell
When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.
