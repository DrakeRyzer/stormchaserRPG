## Poisonous
**Actions:** 1<br>

After a successful melee attack, a poisonous creature can then make an additional attack vs the Constitution defence of the target. On a hit, the target takes an additional 1dM poison damage and is [poisoned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Poisoned/) until the beginning of its next turn.
