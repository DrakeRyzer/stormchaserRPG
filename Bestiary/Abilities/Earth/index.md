## Earth Glide
A creature with earth glide can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth, except metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, they can even glide through lava. A creature can move in this manner at a speed equal to its walking speed. This burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence.
