## Earth Glide
You can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, you can even glide through lava. You can move in this manner at a speed equal to your walking speed. This burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence.
