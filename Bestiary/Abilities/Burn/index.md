## Burn
A creature with the burn ability causes another creature to ignite when on a successful melee attack, or if it pass through or stops in another creature's space. Additionally, this occurs when another creature successfully hits a creature with the burn ability.

An ignited creature takes 1dM fire damage when ignited and again at the end of its subsequent turns until a creature douses or smothers the flames, requiring 2 actions to do so.
