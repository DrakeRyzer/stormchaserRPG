# Rush
**Actions:** 1<br>

A creature with the rush ability can attempt one of the following if it first moves at least 20 feet straight forward towards its target.

Strike: Make a single melee attack gaining +1d. The attack deals additional damage equal to the distance moved divided by 5.

Slam: Make a [Shove](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Shove/) attack with +1d. On a success, the target is shoved twice the normal distance, or shoved as normal and then knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/). It may then choose to move up to five feet in the direction that the target was shoved.
