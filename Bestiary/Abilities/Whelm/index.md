# Whelm
**Actions:** 2

A creature with the whelm ability can make an unarmed attack vs the Strength defence of each creature that it shares a space with and that are not greater than one size larger. On a hit, a target takes bludgeoning damage equal to its unarmed strike. Additionally, it may choose one creature that is of its size or one size larger, or two creatures smaller than it, those chosen creatures are [grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) and [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) and are unable to breathe unless they can breathe water. On a miss, a target takes half damage and is pushed harmlessly out of its space.
