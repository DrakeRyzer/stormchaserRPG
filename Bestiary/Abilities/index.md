# Monster Abilities
Special actions that monsters may have. 

Some of these abilities can also gain by characters through some transformation, like the [Beast Shape](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Transmutation/#beast-shape) or [Elemental Body](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/5/Transmutation/#elemental-body) spells.
