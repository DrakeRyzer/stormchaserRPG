# Rake
**Actions:** 1<br>

A creature with this special attack gains extra natural attacks when it grapples its foe. In addition to the options available to all grapplers, a creature with the rake ability may make two [Strikes](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Strike/) against a grappled foe as a single action. A creature with the rake ability must begin its turn already grappling to use its rake. It canâ€™t begin a grapple and rake in the same turn.
