## Whirlwind
**Actions:** 2

A creature with the whirlwind ability can make an unarmed attack vs the Strength defence of each creature that it shares a space with and that are not greater than one size larger. On a hit, a target takes bludgeoning damage equal to its unarmed strike. Additionally, it may choose one creature that is of its size or one size larger, or two creatures smaller than it. Those chosen creatures are thrown 20 feet in a random direction and knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/). If a target is thrown into another creature, make an unarmed attack against that creature vs its Dexterity defence; on a hit, it takes the same damage and is knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/). If you miss on any of these attacks, a target takes half the damage and isn't thrown or knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/).
