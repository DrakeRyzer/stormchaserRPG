# Constrict
**Actions:** 1<br>

A creature with the constrict ability deals damage after a successful [Grapple](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Grapple/) equal to 1dM + Strength modifier bludgeoning damage and the creature is also [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/). This ability can also be used to automatically deal the same damage on subsequent turns. Only one creature can be constricted at a time, as the creature's entire body or all its limbs are being used to crush the target.
