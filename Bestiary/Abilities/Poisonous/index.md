# Poisonous
**Actions:** 1<br>

On a successful melee attack, compare the attack roll to the target's Constitution defence. On a hit, the target takes an additional 1dM poison damage and is [poisoned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Poisoned/) until the beginning of its next turn.
