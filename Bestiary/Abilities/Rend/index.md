## Rend
If a creature with the rend ability hits the same target with at least two melee attacks in one turn, it begins to bleed. The target takes 1dM bleed damage at the end of its turn until it has received healing or a creature makes a successful Medicine check vs its weapon skill to stop the bleeding.
