# Villager
Far away from the protection of armies and uncomfortably close to the borders beyond which anything might roam, day-to-day life as a villager is routine, but a future is far from guaranteed. Village life can be simple and mundane, filled with the humdrum-but-insistent needs of farm animals and crops. However, there can be far worse than wolves stalking the woods and, at any moment, a villager's life can be punctuated by upheaval

More so than larger towns and cities, a village is a community. With rarely more than a few hundred citizens, for better or worse everybody knows everybody in a village. There can be spiteful rivalries and old grudges, but most regard the entire village as their homestead, to be cared for and protected together. A warm hearth, lifelong friends and homegrown food are a universal way of life, enjoyed by countless peoples of all shapes and sizes.

Characters raised in the village culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.

## Alignment
A village is a community that relies upon and sustains itself. Every person contributes to the whole prosperity and as such everyone is expected to put their share of work in where they fit best. Villagers will generally be neutral or good as they seek to provide for their community and expect the same in return.

## Features

### Agrarian Life
Life in the countryside is simple and peaceful. However, when danger approaches the village and there are no adventurers around, it's often left to the villagers to defend themselves with whatever they have on hand.

You are trained in your choice of [Animal Handling](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/AnimalHandling/), or improvised weapons.

### Tall Tales
Life along the crossroads rarely offers an opportunity for proper schooling, but the roads carry with them legends and stories from far and wide. You may choose to use Wisdom when making [History](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/History/), [Nature](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Nature/), or [Theology](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Theology/) checks. However, the GM may decide that the results of a check made in this way are distorted or exaggerated forms of the truth.

### Village Watch
You have +1d to Perception while keeping watch during a rest.

## Languages
You speak, read and write your local language with native proficiency. For example, a villager from the kingdom of Breanne speaks Breannian.

Choose one language from a neighbouring region. You speak, read and write this language with accented proficiency.
