# Hordling
Some war hordes obliterate the target of their wrath within the day and life simply returns to normal, but others can last a lifetime. When the offender is an entire nation or a powerful figure like a sovereign or tyrant, the march can seem to go on forever. Hordling life is driven by one simple goal: the destruction of their foe.

When hordes last for years, decades, or even centuries, generations of people are raised only knowing war. The elders may recount memories of happier days, but the songs and ballads that recount their history slowly become war chants.

Characters raised in the hordling culture share a variety of features in common with one another.

## Features

### Pack Tactics
You have +1d on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Trained for War
You can use this trait to take the Aid action on your turn as a free action and you can do so a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. You may only do so once per turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you use the Aid action in this way, choose one of the options below on a success:
* **Hold.** You and the creature you aid each gain an amount of temporary stamina equal to 1dR + Constitution modifier.
* **March.** You and the creature you aid each increase your walking speeds by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
* **Strike.** Until the start of your next turn, the first time the creature that you help hits a target with an attack roll, that target gains -1d on the next attack roll it makes within the next minute.

## Languages
You speak, read and write either Goblin or Orc with native proficiency and the other with accented proficiency.
