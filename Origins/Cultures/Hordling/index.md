# Hordling
Some war hordes obliterate the target of their wrath within the day and life simply returns to normal, but others can last a lifetime. When the offender is an entire nation or a powerful figure like a sovereign or tyrant, the march can seem to go on forever. Hordling life is driven by one simple goal: the destruction of their foe.

When hordes last for years, decades, or even centuries, generations of people are raised only knowing war. The elders may recount memories of happier days, but the songs and ballads that recount their history slowly become war chants.

Characters raised in the hordling culture share a variety of features in common with one another.
