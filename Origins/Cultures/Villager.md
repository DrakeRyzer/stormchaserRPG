# Villager
Far away from the protection of armies and uncomfortably close to the borders beyond which anything might roam, day-to-day life as a villager is routine - but a future is far from guaranteed. Village life can be simple and mundane, filled with the humdrum but insistent needs of farm animals and crops, though there can be far worse than wolves stalking the woods and at any moment, a villager's life can be punctuated by upheaval

More so than larger towns and cities, a village is a community. With rarely more than a few hundred citizens, for better or worse everybody knows everybody in a village. There can be spiteful rivalries and old grudges, but most regard their entire village as their homestead, to be cared for and protected together. A warm hearth, lifelong friends, and homegrown food are a universal way of life, enjoyed by countless peoples of all shapes and sizes.

Characters raised in the village culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.

## Alignment
A village is a community that relies upon and sustains itself. Every person contributes to the whole prosperity, and as such everyone is expected to put their share of work in where they fit best. Villagers will generally be neutral or good as they seek to provide for their community and expect the same in return.
