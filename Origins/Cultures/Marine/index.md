# Marine Realm
Characters raised in the marine realm culture share a variety of features in common with one another.

## Alignment
The denizens of marine realms love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

## Features

### Friend of the Sea
Using gestures and sounds, you can communicate simple ideas with any beast that has an innate swimming speed.

### Marine Lore
You gain the Swimming and Marine Lore subskills.

### Exotic Weapon Training
You are trained with any weapon with the word “elven” in its name or properties.

## Languages
You speak, read and write either Elvish or Aquan with native proficiency and the other with accented proficiency.

Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
