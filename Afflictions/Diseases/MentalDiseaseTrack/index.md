# Mental Disease Track
* **Healthy**
* **Latent/Carrier:** A character in the latent stage has the disease, and may pass it on if contagious, but suffers no ill effects.
* **Weakened:** A character weakened by a mental disease suffers all the effects of the shaken condition. The DCs of their spells and spell-like abilities decrease by 2. If they are a spellcaster, they can no longer cast their highest level of spells.
* **Impaired:** A character impaired by a mental disease no longer adds their mental ability score modifiers to the number of uses per day of pools (such as a ki pool), abilities (such as channel and lay on hands) and spells known or prepared. Their DCs decrease by an additional 2. If they are a spellcaster, they can no longer cast their 2 highest levels of spells.
* **Befuddled:** A character befuddled by a mental disease is losing their grasp on thought, reality, and self. They have a 50% chance each round to take no relevant action, instead babbling randomly, wandering off, or talking to unseen things.
* **Deranged:** A character rendered deranged by a mental disease is almost entirely disconnected from reality. Their mind filters and twists all external stimuli into strange forms.
* **Comatose:** A character rendered comatose by a mental disease has lost all grip on reality and entered an inner world of dreams. They can’t be woken by any means as long as they remain in this state on the disease track.
* **Dead:** The disease has harmed the character’s brain beyond repair, killing them. The corpse may still be contagious, and some diseases may have unusual effects after the character dies.
