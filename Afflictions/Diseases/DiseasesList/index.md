# Diseases List
If a disease does not specify an effect, it imposes only the effects for the victim's state on the pertinent track. Not everything listed here is a true “disease”. Some are more accurately described as infections, parasites, etc.

## Athrakitis
This disease spreads through particles exuded from the decomposing corpses of infected animals. Infective particles can survive in the soil for decades or even centuries. The disease typically occurs when grazing mammals ingest or breathe the spores while eating ground vegetation. Anthrakitis causes a wide variety of symptoms as it attacks the skin, digestive system, or respiratory system; symptoms include fatigue, difficulty breathing, ulcers, loss of appetite, and nausea. Any victim infected with anthrakitis can also spread the disease. Those who come into contact with a victim must are attacked by the disease. The bodies of those killed by anthrakitis are also infectious and remain so until destroyed.<br>
**Type** Disease, Contact, Inhaled, or Ingested; **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>

## Basidirond Spores
**Type** Disease, Inhaled; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>
**Recovery** 1 miss

## Blightburn Sickness
Caused by blightburn radiation.<br>
**Type** Disease, Contact; **Attack** +12 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical and Mental; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** Contact is automatic when a creature comes within a 60-foot radius, and can be blocked only by lead sheeting, 1 foot of stone, or a force effect<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Blinding Sickness
**Type** Disease, Ingested; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes. At the impaired state, the victim becomes permanently blind.<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses. Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with a herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.

## Blister Phage
This disease causes a painful and hideous outbreak of facial tumors and a sickening deterioration of the skin across the entire body, and also works on the minds of some, slowly driving them insane.<br>
**Type** Disease, Contact or Injested; **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical and Mental; **Frequency** 1/day

## Bloody End
This disease causes the body to produce blood filled with sanguine humours and adrenaline, making the victim incredibly violent and savage. It is spread by contact with the tainted blood — so while it is safe to touch creatures in the early stages of the disease, coming into contact with even the smallest amount of a diseased creature’s blood allows the disease to spread.<br>
**Type** Disease, Contact; **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Special; **Frequency** 1/hour<br>
**Effect** Healthy—Carrier—Early—Moderate—Severe—Terminal; Advantage to hit the poisoned creature's Wisdom defence for 1 hour<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

**Carrier** The affected creature becomes more irritable and aggressive than normal, but otherwise there are no symptoms of the disease at this stage.

**Early** The affected creature’s skin darkens, and the creature’s attitude worsens, making it prone to violent outbursts. The affected creature gains +2 strength, and loses -4 Dexterity. Its tainted blood is unable to clot, and rushes out of even minor wounds. Whenever the affected creature takes at least 5 points of piercing or slashing damage, it also takes an additional 2 points of damage. Whenever the affected creature takes damage in this way, a thin but far-reaching spray of blood erupts from the wound, exposing all creatures in a 15-foot cone (pointing toward the source of the attack) to the disease with a +10 ranged attack vs Dexterity defence.

**Moderate** Blood begins to ooze through the affected creature’s pores, coating its skin in a thin, red sheen. The bonus to Strength increases to +4, and the penalty to Dexterity becomes –8. Whenever the affected creature takes damage, the disease makes an attack vs its Wisdom defence. On a hit, the creature flies into a berserk rage and is compelled to attack the nearest creature each round for 1 minute, regardless of whether it's a friend or foe. The amount of additional damage that the affected creature takes after being dealt 5 or more points of piercing or slashing damage increases to 5.

**Severe** The berserker rage caused by the disease clouds the mind of the affected creature, which is constantly compelled to attack the nearest creature. The affected creature can attempt a Wisdom defence check at a DC of 10 + the disease’s attack bonus as a free action to suppress this effect for 1 minute, but if it fails this check, it can’t try again for 1 hour. Even if it succeeds, the disease continues to attack its Wisdom defence whenever it takes damage, sending the creature flying back into a berserk state on hit.

**Terminal** The affected creature can no longer attempt a defence check to suppress its rage. If it is hit by a disease attack at this stage, it dies. Even on a miss, the affected creature takes 10d10 points of damage and 2 points of Constitution drain. If the affected creature dies, its body explodes in a shower of gore attacking the Dexterity defence of all creatures within 20 feet with an attack bonus of +10. Those hit are exposed to the disease.

## Bluespit
This bacterial infection thrives in avian and mammalian lungs. The name is derived from the blue-tinged sputum coughed up by victims — at least until they finally keel over.<br>
**Type** Disease, Inhaled; **Attack** +4 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** 1d6 non-lethal damage. The non-lethal damage cannot be healed while the disease remains. A victim that accumulates sufficient damage to fall unconscious while infected with bluespit begins to suffocate. Despite being unconscious, the victim is considered to be holding its breath rather than immediately progressing to death saves.<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Bog Rot
**Type** Disease, Contact; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** Creatures afflicted with bog rot do not heal naturally and gain only one-half benefit from magical healing until the disease is cured.<br>

## Bonecrusher (Dengue) Fever
The name of this mosquito-borne illness comes from the terrifying sensation sufferers experience, as if their bones were being squeezed to pulp from within. The illness then leads to severe headaches, high fevers, and a distinctive rash of bright red dots across the lower limbs and chest.<br>
**Type** Disease, Injury; **Attack** +2 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Boot Soup
This infection is named for its ultimate result, should it go untreated for long periods of time. A fuzzy reddish-brown fungus grows painlessly between the toes and spreads from there to the top of the foot over the course of a day. If not removed within 24 hours, the character’s movement speed is reduced by 5 feet for every day the infection is left to spread. It is only at this point that the character begins to feel pain as the fungus starts consuming living tissue and nerves, eventually leading to paralysis.<br>
**Type** Disease (Fungus), Contact; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** Speed reduced by 5 feet, creatures reduced to speed 0 feet are permanently paralyzed.<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses, or completely skinning or burning the affected area (inflicting 1d8 points of damage)

## Brain Moss
This bright blue fungus grows inside the brain tissue of a living creature, altering the brain’s chemistry to make the host docile, and eventually consuming the host’s brain while it is still alive. In severe cases of the disease, telltale blue fuzz can often be found growing out of the victim’s ears and nostrils.<br>
**Type** Disease, Inhaled; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Special; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** Healthy—Carrier—Early—Moderate—Severe—Terminal; Advantage to hit the poisoned creature's Wisdom defence and disadvantage on Wisdom-based ability checks for 1 day<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

**Carrier** At this stage, the affected creature experiences colors and sounds with more intensity than it normally would, but there are otherwise no effects.

**Early** The affected creature’s mind is flooded with calming chemicals, which put the creature in a tranquil, calm state. The affected creature cannot gain any bonuses or penalties from morale-based effects and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, damage rolls and Insight checks, as the brain moss interferes with critical thinking.

**Moderate** The affected creature becomes placid and incredibly impressionable and cannot take hostile actions. Whenever another creature takes a hostile action against the affected creature, make a disease attack roll vs the creature's Wisdom defence. On a miss, the effect is suppressed for 1 minute. Additionally, whenever anyone makes a request of the affected creature, make a disease attack roll vs the creature's Wisdom defence. On a hit, the creature is compelled to perform the request, similar to a creature hit by the *suggestion* spell, except this suggestibility is a non-magical disease effect (not a spell, spell-like ability, enchantment, or compulsion).

**Severe** The fungus begins to cause intense hallucinations in the affected creature, making it constantly confused. Additionally, once every 1d4 hours, it has a hallucination that causes it to be dazed for 1 minute, after which time its Wisdom defence is attacked by the disease. On a hit, the creature is compelled to perform an act chosen by the GM or determined at random, as a result of the delusions (similar to the effect at the moderate stage).

**Terminal** The fungus begins to consume the brain tissue of the affected creature, whose brain can no longer control its body. The affected creature falls unconscious and remains unconscious for as long as it remains at this stage of the disease. If it is hit by a disease attack at this stage, it dies. Even if it is missed at this stage, it takes 4 points of Constitution and Intelligence damage.

## Brainworms
Individually, these tiny parasites are almost invisible to the naked eye, yet en masse they're capable of taking down even the strongest animals. Entering the body through contact with an infected host or corpse (especially through open wounds), these thin worms quickly migrate to the brain and begin reproducing. The infestation is typically evidenced by a dulling of the senses and intellect and by erratic bouts of irrational rage toward other creatures during which the worms attempt to spread to other hosts through combat and injury. Examining the brain of a late-stage victim reveals a living carpet of thousands of tiny parasites.<br>
**Type** Disease (Parasite), Contact or Injury; **Attack** +4 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Mental; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** If damaged in combat, the disease attacks the creature's Constitution defence. On a hit, the creature must roll each round on the chart from the *confusion* spell to determine their actions for the duration of the encounter<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Bubonic Plague
Infected vermin and parasites spread this disease, also known as Daemon’s Touch or the Black Death, through their bites. Once contracted, the disease spreads quickly, polluting the victim’s body with toxins. As the disease reaches the lymph nodes, the victim suffers extreme inflammation of glands, and his skin might take on a black pallor. Symptoms include fever, headaches, nausea, fatigue, and swelling of the lymph nodes (called buboes) on the neck, underarms, and inner thigh areas, and eventually bleeding beneath the skin.<br>
**Type** Disease, Injury or Inhaled; **Attack** +7 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Cackle Fever
**Type** Disease, Inhaled; **Attack** +3 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Mental; **Onset** 1d4 hours; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: "the shrieks". Symptoms include fever and disorientation.

Any event that causes the infected creature great stress - including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare - provokes a disease attack against the creature. On a hit, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter or 1 minute. The creature is attacked again at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a miss.

Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter is attacked and may become infected with the disease. Once a creature is missed, it is immune to the mad laughter of that infected creature for 24 hours.<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses. On a miss, the attack roll drops by 1d6. A creature that is hit three times gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness.

## Cholera
**Type** Disease (Injury); **Attack** +3 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
A carrion golem transmits cholera on a successful slam attack.

## Coward’s Mark
Externally manifesting as round marks on the skin like ringworm, this fungal infection soon spreads to the nervous system. The corpses of victims that succumb to coward’s mark sprout thousands of fruiting bodies 1d4 days after death, spreading the infection on the wind.<br>
**Type** Disease, Contact or Inhaled; **Attack** +3 vs Constitution<br>
**Track** Physical and Mental; **Frequency** 1/day Initial<br>
**Effect** If the victim is hit 2 days in a row (not counting the initial hit), they develop a secondary effect, or the existing secondary effect worsens. Curing the affliction immediately removes all accumulated secondary effects.

The first time the disease progresses, the victim becomes shaken whenever other creatures (including allies) are within 30 feet. After the second progression, the victim is attacked vs Wisdom defence (attack bonus equal to the disease's attack bonus) or become frightened each time any creature approaches within 30 feet. The victim must defend against any specific creature only once every 24 hours.

With the third and final progression, the disease’s attack bonus increases by 2, and the reaction upon a hit increases to panicked. After the third progression, the victim feels safe only in complete solitude. The secondary effects of coward’s mark are mind-affecting fear effects.<br>
**Recovery** 3 consecutive misses

## Dementia Dust
**Type** Disease, Inhaled; **Attack** +4 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Mental; **Frequency** 1/week<br>
**Effect** Even if the disease is removed with *lesser restoration*, condition does not improve without *greater restoration* or *heal*.<br>
**Recovery** magic only

## Demon Fever
**Type** Disease, Injury; **Attack** +8 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** At the impaired state, penalties from the weakened state become permanent until victim receives heal or restoration.<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Devil Chills
**Type** Disease, Injury; **Attack** +4 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Recovery** 3 consecutive misses

## Dysentery
A broad family of intestinal afflictions caused by everything from bacteria to viruses to parasitic worms, dysentery is characterized by explosive and sometimes bloody diarrhea, leading to dehydration and occasionally death.<br>
**Type** Disease (Parasite), Contact or Injury; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** 1d6 nonlethal damage<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Enteric Fever
Enteric fever, also known as typhoid fever in temperate climates, breeds within contaminated foods, especially raw or undercooked meats. Symptoms include high fever, profuse sweating, and nausea. As the disease progresses, enteric fever victims suffer from severe headaches, exhaustion, and abdominal pain, as rose-colored spots appear on the chest and abdominal areas. At that point, the victim is prone to dehydration and falls into bouts of delirium and nervous shakes.<br>
**Type** Disease, Ingested; **Attack** +5 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Recovery** –<br>
A carrion golem transmits typhoid fever on a successful slam attack.

## Filth Fever
**Type** Disease, Contact or Injury; **Attack** +2 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps.

The infected creature regains only half the normal amount of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Final Rest
A disease brought from a ruined starship, final rest saps emotion until the victim simply gives up living.<br>
**Type** Disease, Inhaled; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Mental; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** The victim cannot gain morale bonuses, mind-affecting effects have disadvantage to hit it and it must defend even against harmless mind-affecting effects.<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Firegut
Though less extreme than true dysentery, this disease is characterized by occasional vomiting of burning bile. It is extremely tenacious.<br>
**Type** Disease, Injury or Inhaled; **Attack** +7 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Recovery** 3 consecutive misses

## Ghoul Distemper
This rare, tropical disease causes living creatures to turn into feral, ghoul-like entities, and when fatal, often causes the affected creature to rise as a ghoul. The creature’s metabolism rises at an incredible rate, forcing it to devour untenable amounts of food. Eating only further fuels the disease, and all victims of this affliction quickly develop an emaciated, corpselike appearance.<br>
**Type** Disease, Ingested, Inhaled, or Injury; **Attack** +8 Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Special; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** Healthy—Carrier—Early—Moderate—Severe—Terminal; Advantage to hit the poisoned creature's Constitution and Wisdom defences for 1 day<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

**Carrier** The affected creature becomes voraciously hungry, and must consume double the normal amount of food each day it remains at this stage or risk starvation.

**Early** The affected creature's skin turns a deep shade of yellow, while the creature’s temperature begins to rise. Additionally, the affected creature’s ravenous appetite worsens. As long as it remains at this stage of the disease or worse, it treats each hour as though it were a full day for the purposes of the frequency and amount of food it must eat in order to avoid starvation (including time spent sleeping). Finally, it develops a strong craving for raw meat, and must consume at least 4 ounces of uncooked meat per hour or become nauseated until it does so.

**Moderate** The affected creature’s body begins to quickly waste away, as muscle and fat are consumed to feed its growing hunger. Further, its body begins to constantly exude a stench of rotting meat, which cannot be removed with any amount of bathing. The affected creature is constantly nauseated. Additionally, whenever the creature takes non-lethal damage from starvation, it takes 3d6 points of damage, rather than 1d6. Finally, whenever it comes within 10 feet of any amount of meat, including the bodies of slain creatures, the disease attacks its Wisdom defence. On a hit, the creature is compelled to spend 1 minute gorging itself on the meat.

**Severe** The affected creature’s teeth begin to grow and twist painfully, fusing together to form four massive fangs. The creature gains a primary bite natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if Small). Further, its hunger-addled mind drives it to favour this attack over all others. It can no longer cast spells or use other activated special abilities, nor can it use manufactured weapons; it is only able to make attacks with its bite and other natural attacks. Finally, whenever the affected creature takes non-lethal damage from starvation, it takes 6d6 points of damage, rather than 1d6.

**Terminal** The affected creature completely loses control. It is compelled to attack any living creature it encounters in an attempt to devour its victim's flesh, preferably while still alive. Player characters who reach this stage are under the GM's control until they are cured. Additionally, whenever the affected creature takes non-lethal damage from starvation, it also takes 2 points of Constitution damage. If it is hit by the disease at this stage, it dies. A creature that dies while at this stage of the disease rises as a ghoul (or ghast, if it had 5 or more Hit Dice) after 24 hours.

## Gore Worms
These parasites derive their name from their habit of devouring their hosts from the inside, leaving them as putrid sacs of blood and worms. Gore worms release their microscopic eggs in spore-like clouds that make their way into the bloodstream when inhaled. Eventually, the eggs anchor themselves within a host’s body and grow until they reach nearly 2 inches in length. Adults burrow out through the host’s skin and release their eggs into the air. The worms cannot survive outside of a host for more than a few hours, though they can inhabit corpses as easily as living creatures.<br>
**Type** Disease, Inhaled; **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Special; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** Healthy—Carrier—Early—Moderate—Severe—Terminal; Disadvantage on attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 day, advantage to hit the poisoned creature's Constitution defence 1 day<br>
**Recovery** Magic only

**Carrier** The gore worm eggs travel throughout the creature’s body via its circulatory system. The affected creature doesn't suffer any particular symptoms at this stage.

**Early** The affected creature develops swelling, blister-like growths that ooze blood and are incredibly painful when touched. Whenever the creature takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it takes 1d6 additional points of non-lethal damage. Additionally, if the creature is wearing armour, then whenever it takes an action, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, or 2d6 points if wearing heavy armour.

**Moderate** The gore worms hatch. The affected creature can feel them writhing and moving beneath its skin, and others can even see the worms moving occasionally. The affected creature is constantly nauseated. Furthermore, whenever it takes more than a single standard or bonus action in a round, the worms roil angrily, causing the host to become poisoned for 1d4 rounds afterward. Finally, magical healing greatly agitates the worms, and whenever the affected creature is the target of a healing spell, the worms whip into a frenzy, dealing 2 points of Constitution damage.

**Severe** The gore worms burrow holes through the affected creature’s skin and extend portions of their bodies out into the air, giving the appearance that the affected creature’s body has been covered in dozens of tiny gaping mouths with serpentine tongues. The affected creature is constantly incapacitated and gains a level of exhaustion.

**Terminal** The gore worms begin devouring the affected creature’s internal organs. The affected creature is constantly poisoned. If it is hit by the disease at this stage, it dies. Even if it is missed, it takes 10d10 points of damage and 2 points of Constitution drain, in addition to the disease’s normal effects.

## Green Haze
This mold tends to begin growing in the folds of the eyelids. Over the course of a day, it spreads to cover the eyelids and begins to cover the eyeball. If left untreated, this mold can cause the character to go permanently blind.<br>
**Type** Disease (Fungus), Contact; **Attack** +3 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** Disadvantage on Perception checks, if the target is hit 3 times it is permanently blinded<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Greenscale
This disgusting disease causes patches of skin to harden and crack, weeping greenish pus and covering the body with putrid, scale-like patterns. The disease is most commonly contracted through injury or other blood-to-blood contact with an infected creature, though certain carrion eaters of the jungle particularly birds have been known to play host to the disease without themselves suffering from it.<br>
**Type** Disease, Injury; **Attack** +5 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/week<br>
**Effect** Target suffers 1 point of Charisma drain.<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Leprosy
Leprosy is spread by victims of the disease through direct—even casual—contact. Leprosy results in skin lesions, extreme nasal congestion, and wounds that do not heal. A highly visible malady, leprosy can permanently disfigure those who don’t receive magical aid. If left untreated, the victim develops sores and becomes easily fatigued. While leprosy can prove difficult to contract, few overcome the disease once infected. Suffering from a slow deterioration, particularly hardy lepers can remain quite active for years after first exhibiting signs of the disease.<br>
**Type** Disease, Contact, Inhaled, or Injury; **Attack** +2 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical (Special); **Frequency** 1/week<br>
**Effect** Healthy—Latent/Carrier—Sluggish—Stiffened; sluggish and stiffened are as Dexterity poison, stiffened is an end state.<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Malaria (Jungle Fever)
A classic traveler’s nightmare, malaria is transmitted by the bites of mosquitoes and leads to fever, vomiting, shivering, and convulsions, and sometimes even severe brain damage, particularly in children.<br>
**Type** Disease, Injury; **Attack** +8 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Mindfire
**Type** Disease, Inhaled; **Attack** +2 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track**Mental; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Mummy Rot
**Type** Disease, Injury; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Tracks** Physical and Mental (special); **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** No latent/carrier state; victim suffers all penalties from progressing on both the physical and mental disease tracks.<br>
**Recovery** *Lesser restoration* and *remove curse* within 1 minute of each other.

## Pulsing Puffs
A character who has taken a wound (or even a small scratch) that remains unhealed for any length of time may soon find small blue-white spores sprouting within it. These spores quickly grow into phosphorescent, domed mounds that pulse along with the bearer’s heartbeat. At first, the only effect of the growths is to prevent natural healing of the wound. However, if left untreated for more than a day, the spores take deeper root. Due to the fungus’s beauty, some jungle tribes are known to cultivate it on the bound bodies of their prisoners.<br>
**Type** Disease (Fungus), Injury; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Rabies
**Type** Disease, Injury; **Attack** +4 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Mental; **Frequency** 1/day
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Rapture Pox
**Type** Disease, Injury; **Attack** +4 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Mental; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
A carrion golem transmits rapture pox on a successful slam attack.

## Red Ache
**Type** Disease, Injury; **Attack** +5 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** 1d6 strength damage<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Red Drip
The first sign that a character has the red drip is an inflammation of the cuticles and hands. If left untreated, the cuticles begin to bleed and the hands swell until the nails blacken and fall off entirely. From there, the hands become a mess of oozing sores, festering and rotting. The infection then spreads up the arms and into the chest, killing the victim. Fortunately, this fungus generally only attacks one hand at a time, making amputation an effective cure.<br>
**Type** Disease (Fungus), Contact; **Attack** +8 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses or amputation of infected hand

## Scarlet Leprosy
**Type** Disease (Injury); **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** 1 point of permanent Constitution drain.<br>
A carrion golem transmits scarlet leprosy on a successful slam attack.

## Shakes
**Type** Disease, Contact; **Attack** +3 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Physical; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** 1d8 Dex damage<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Shattermind
Shattermind refers to a group of related infectious mental patterns spread by skin-to-skin contact between infected victims. Most forms of shattermind affect only humanoids and monstrous humanoids. Each form of shattermind spreads a different form of insanity to its victims. *Lesser restoration* allows the victim to roll to defend, but is not a cure.<br>
**Type** Disease, Contact; **Attack** +7 vs Wisdom Defence<br>
**Track** Mental; **Frequency** 1/day<br>
**Effect** On any day the victim is hit, they suffer the effects of a type of insanity. Unlike normal insanity, on any day that they are missed (using the attack bonus for shattermind, not their form of insanity), they regain their sanity for that day. A given variety of shattermind spreads the same form of insanity to all victims.<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

## Skin Wastes
This disease brings intense itching, then hardening and cracking of the skin, and eventually the transformation of all soft tissue to bone.<br>
**Type** Disease, Contact; **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Special; **Frequency** 1/hour<br>
**Effect** –4 Dexterity and attacks vs Constitution defence have advantage for 1 hour<br>
**Recovery** 2 consecutive misses

**Carrier** The affected creature suffers from itchy, irritating skin, and localized, splotchy rashes. At this stage, the disease has no mechanical effect.

**Early** The affected creature’s skin becomes gray and flaky. The itchiness caused by the disease worsens and the disease attacks the creature each waking hour. On a hit, the creature frantically spends much of that hour scratching away at its skin. For each hit after the first in the same day, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage, as its scratching begins to break the skin.

**Moderate** The itching intensifies, and the amount of damage dealt by scratching increases to 1d8. Additionally, during combat and other stressful situations, the affected creature must scratch its skin each round as a bonus action. Each round, the affected creature can suppress the need to scratch that round with a successful Wisdom defence check at a DC of 10 + the disease’s attack bonus, but if it attempts the defence check and fails, it spends the entire round scratching.

**Severe** The affected creature’s skin becomes cracked and broken, and even moving is incredibly painful. As long as the creature remains at this stage, the affected creature is nauseated and incapacitated. Additionally, whenever the affected creature takes damage, it takes double the amount of damage it normally would.

**Terminal** The affected creature’s skin and organs slowly transform into solid bone, until eventually the creature is effectively petrified. The creature is constantly poisoned. For the first 24 hours at this stage, its Dexterity score is reduced by 1 each hour. During this time, its skin and organs transform into a single, solid mass of bone. Once its Dexterity score reaches 0 or after 24 hours have passed, it is petrified. A stone to flesh spell can undo the petrification, but the disease immediately attacks the creature's Constitution defence. On a miss, the creature dies. On a hit, its Dexterity is again reduced by 1 each hour. It eventually becomes petrified once more unless cured.

## Sleeping Sickness
This parasitic affliction is spread by flying insects injecting tiny parasites into the victim’s bloodstream and inducing fever, headache, joint pain, swelling of glands in the back and neck, and most notably fatigue. The disease gradually infects the brain, causing confusion, reduced coordination, difficulty keeping track of time, and insomnia. The best cure for this disease is dosing the patient with the poison arsenic if the patient survives, there’s a cumulative 30% chance that the disease is immediately cured.<br>
**Type** Disease (Parasite), Injury; **Attack** +4 vs Constitution Defence<br>
