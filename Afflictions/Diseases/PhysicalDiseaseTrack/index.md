# Physical Disease Track
* **Healthy**
* **Latent/Carrier:** A character in this stage has the disease, and may pass it on if contagious, but suffers no ill effects.
* **Weakened:** A character weakened by a physical disease suffers a level of exhaustion.
* **Impaired:** A character impaired by a physical disease suffers an additional level of exhaustion. Whenever they take an action, they must succeed at a Constitution defence check with a DC of 10 + the disease's attack bonus or lose the action and gain the nauseated condition for 1 minute.
* **Incapacitated:** A character incapacitated by a physical disease gains the incapacitated condition.
* **Bedridden:** A character rendered bedridden by a physical disease is awake and can converse, but can’t stand on their own or take any actions. Their speed is 0.
* **Comatose:** A character rendered comatose by physical disease is unconscious and feverish. They can’t be woken by any means as long as they remain in this state on the disease track.
* **Dead:** The disease overcomes the body's immune system, and the character dies. The corpse may be still be contagious, and some diseases may have unusual effects after the character dies.
