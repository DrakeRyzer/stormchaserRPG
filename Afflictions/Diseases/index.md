## Diseases
The disease track simulates the progression of a disease, starting with incubation. If the diseaseâ€™s cure entry does not allow a cure, the disease's progression is irreversible without the use of a *heal* spell, and even a successful *lesser restoration* only prevents further deterioration.

There are two different tracks: one for diseases that affect physical ability scores (such as bubonic plague or slimy doom), and one for those that affect mental ability scores (such as cackle fever or mindfire).
