# Poisons List
The sample poisons listed below represent just some of the common poisons available in cities. Of course, most cities have laws against buying, selling, or crafting poison.

If a poison does not specify an effect, it imposes only the effects for the victim’s state on the pertinent track.

## Arsenic
**Price** 120 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Ingested; **Attack** +3 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Constitution; **Onset** 10 minutes; **Frequency** 1/minute for 4 minutes<br>
**Cure** 1 miss

## Azure Lily Pollen
An azure lily's pollen is rather toxic, with a single lily producing enough pollen in its short life to swiftly paralyze most creatures. A character that picks one of the flowers or brushes against it causes its load of poisonous pollen to burst in a 5-foot cloud that persists for 1 minute before dispersing. It's possible to harvest the toxic pollen from these lilies with a successful DC 30 Survival check and 10 minutes of stressful work (failure causes the lily to burst), but once taken from the plant, the raw pollen becomes inert after a week unless crafted into refined poison with a DC 15 poisoner's kit check. A successfully harvested dose of azure lily poison is worth 1,500 gp.<br>
**Price** 1500 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Inhaled; **Attack** +5 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Frequency** 1/minute for 2 minutes<br>
**Effect** Poisoned for 1 minute/paralysed for 2d4 hours.<br>

**Track** Strength; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>
**Cure** 1 miss

## Blackfingers’s Salt
Blackfingers’s salt can easily be hidden in all foods and beverages, as it lacks color, odor, and, despite the name, flavor. Soon after consuming this dastardly poison, a creature develops painful, bleeding ulcers throughout its stomach and esophagus. The inventors originally developed the salt to mimic targets suffering a medical emergency and thus avoid suspicion of poisioning.<br>
**Price** 300 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Ingested; **Attack** +7 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Constitution; **Onset** 10 minutes; **Frequency** 1/minute for 6 minutes<br>

## Blistercap Spore
Found in remote regions deep underground, the blistercap takes its name from the blisters on the bruise-colored cap atop its stem, which weep a toxic yellow fluid. The spores it produces often contribute to the dangers of underground exploration.<br>
**Price** 1,125 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Contact; **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Dexterity and Constitution; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>

**Effect** 2d12 poison damage<br>
**Cure** 1 miss

## Bloodpyre
This orange liquid burns regardless of temperature, which its drow creators claim is a side-effect of its Abyssal inspiration. The staggering pain inflicted by bloodpyre’s slow burn inhibits victims’ mental faculties, but provides fiendish strength, so some drow houses enhance their warriors with bloodpyre despite the pain and damage it causes.<br>
**Price** 1,000 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Contact; **Attack** +4 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>

**Track** Constitution and Wisdom; **Onset** 1 round; **Frequency** 1/round for 4 rounds<br>
**Cure** 1 miss

## Bloodwine
Bloodwine, a favorite serpentfolk drink, is made from the blood of sentient creatures and spiced with brain mold spores and other subterranean seasonings. Its main ingredient is usually drow, duergar, or svirfneblin blood, but the best vintages of bloodwine contain a higher concentration of morlock blood.<br>
**Price** 100 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Ingested; **Attack** +5 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Wisdom; **Frequency** 1/minute for 6 minutes<br>
**Effect** Nauseated for 1d4 hours. Bloodwine affects serpentfolk much like wine affects humans, but it is poisonous to most other creatures. Generally, bloodwine is less harmful to members of races that are used to ingesting blood. Urdefhans suffer no ill effects from drinking it. Drow are immune to the sickening effect but are still susceptible to the bloodwine’s Wisdom damage. Vampires heal 2 hit points or gain 2 temporary hit points for each cup of bloodwine drunk. Immunity to poison gives immunity to the harmful effects of bloodwine.<br>
**Cure** 2 consecutive misses

## Blue Star
This small bright-blue flower has five petals arrayed in a star shape and looks remarkably similar to several other species of blue flowers that live in similar regions, requiring a successful DC 15 Nature or Survival check to correctly identify. The poison causes severe liver damage, making it even more difficult to resist future poisons that a victim may encounter. Although rarely a direct danger to humanoids, the flowers are sometimes consumed by livestock. When this occurs, the venom can be passed on through milk the animals produce for the next week, affecting those who drink it as though they had consumed a dose of blue star.<br>
**Price** 500 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Ingested; **Attack** +5 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Constitution; **Onset** 10 minutes; **Frequency** 1/minute for 6 minutes<br>

## Brinestump Special
Invented as part of a series of dares between feuding goblin camps, this noxious brew fermented from a slurry of swamp flora. The potent intoxicant is popular among goblinoids (who are immune to its nauseating effect), but all other races that partake of this frothy drink are wracked with nausea.<br>
**Price** 400 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Ingested; **Attak** +5 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Onset** 1 round<br>

**Track** Constitution; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>
**Cure** 2 consecutive misses

## Cloudthorn Venom
This potent neurotoxin is created by the cloudthorn plant, a wild bramble whose thorns deliver a poison that numbs its victims to pain, allowing the plant to feast on the blood that flows from the wounds to the ground below. The plant’s name comes from the weightless, airy feeling that victims of the poison experience, which some liken to the notion of walking on clouds.<br>
**Price** 400 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Injury; **Attack** +4 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Strength and Dexterity; **Onset** 1d4 rounds; **Frequency** 1/hour for 3 hours<br>
**Effect** The creature is unable to feel pain for 1 hour, rendering it immune to pain effects. A creature attacking the poisoned creature can attempt a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the poisoned creature’s Perception check in order to attempt to deliver the attack without the target being aware of it, as the creature feels no pain from the attack. If a PC is rendered numb in this way, the GM should secretly track all damage dealt to the character until the numbing effect ends.<br>
**Cure** 1 miss

## Cockatrice Spit
**Price** 1,000 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Contact, Injury, Ingested; **Attack** +2 vs Constitution Defence<br>

**Cure** 1 miss

## Crone’s Curse
A blackish pollen produced by the night witch (a pale, vine-growing flower that blooms in the light of the moon and is hearty enough to survive very rugged and difficult environments), crone’s curse disorients those who inhale it and interferes with the body’s ability to regulate temperature. Merely walking through a field of night witch flowers is often sufficient enough to kick up a cloud of the nearly invisible black particles, which are a mere nuisance in temperate climates but can prove fatal to those exposed to them in deserts and tundra.<br>
**Price** 600 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Inhaled; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Dexterity and Wisdom; **Onset** 1d4 hours; **Frequency** 1/day for 6 days<br>

**Track** Wisdom; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>

**Track** Strength; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>

## Draughtcap Fungus
This yellow-brown mushroom is commonly found in deserts and other dry environments. Its spores absorb moisture at an incredible rate, wreaking havoc on the body of any creature foolish enough to consume it. Draughtcap fungus bears a close resemblance to a common edible mushroom, and a successful DC 20 Nature or Survival check is required to differentiate the two.<br>
**Price** 150 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Ingested; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Strength; **Onset** 4d6 hours; **Frequency** 1/hour for 8 hours<br>
**Effect** As long as a creature is suffering from draughtcap fungus, its body is unable to process liquids, causing the creature to undergo the effects of dehydration no matter how much it drinks and preventing the creature from benefiting from potions, extracts, and other such items. After the first hit, the creature counts as if it had gone without water for 1 day. Further, each additional hit causes the creature to be treated as though it had gone an additional hour without consuming water.<br>
**Cure** 2 consecutive misses

## Dreaming Death
This green and violet gas lulls mortal creatures into a sleep filled with abominable nightmares and maddening half-truths.<br>
**Price** 2,500 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Inhaled; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Special; **Onset** 10 minutes; **Frequency** Once per 10 minutes for 1 hour<br>
**Effect** Creatures that are hit by dreaming death immediately fall into a fitful slumber for 10 minutes. This toxic sleep affects creatures normally immune to magical sleep effects (such as elves), and victims can be woken from the sleep only by overcoming or being cured of the poison. Each hit extends the duration of this magical sleep by 10 minutes. Creatures awaken from these visions scarred and prone to self-harm. Victims must succeed at a Wisdom defence check (DC = 14 + 2 for every 10 minutes spent sleeping) or begin cutting their own flesh with any available weapons. Affected creatures attempt to deliver a coup de grace attack upon themselves every round. A victim can attempt a new Wisdom defence check at the beginning of each round, with cumulative advantage for each round they successfully damaged themselves.<br>

## Goblin’s Eye
These bright red seeds feature a single black dot each, giving them a superficial resemblance to an eye. The bright colors of the seeds make them attractive to certain animals, as well as those unfamiliar with wilderness lore. A character who succeeds at a DC 15 Nature or Survival check identifies the seed as poisonous. In some places, the seeds are used as jewelry.<br>

## Gray Justice
Gray justice has found use as an apparent truth serum since it makes victims more susceptible to interrogation. Additionally, it causes side effects such as lethargy, confusion, and nausea.

Some administer it to prisoners before their execution to make them publicly admit their crimes. The grim truth of the poison is damning, however. Gray justice is no truth serum, but instead compels its victims to say whatever they think will please those around them.<br>

**Track** Wisdom; **Frequency*** 1/minute for 10 minutes<br>

## Hydrofluoric Acid
The wise alchemist takes careful precautions whenever handling hydrofluoric acid. This corrosive substance — an occasional byproduct of volcanic gases that is used for industrial purposes — dissolves bones and causes tissue damage when even a small amount contacts the skin.<br>

**Type** Poison, Contact; **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Strength and Constitution; **Onset** 1 minute; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>

The acid dissolves the body of any victim who dies from hydrofluoric acid poisoning unless the acid is neutralised within 1 minute with a successful DC 20 Medicine or Alchemist's Supplies check.

**Cure** 2 consecutive misses

## Insecticide
Farmers protecting their crops and landlords maintaining their properties use insecticide to clear out pest infestations, but they must avoid the fumes of this dangerous gas. While it is formulated to exterminate vermin, the poison poses a danger to anyone. A single dose of insecticide immediately fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. It can be thrown at a range of 20 feet, and it dissipates after 1d6 rounds in a well-ventilated area. A moderate wind disperses the gas in 1 round.<br>

## Juvebloom
Swindlers claim this green capsule restores the victim’s youth. After 1 day, anyone taking juvebloom sees the seemingly time-bending results in the mirror. However, the benefit is not only temporary but also potentially quite damaging. Particularly daring confidence artists mix this capsule into a solution, attempting to sell it as the much more valuable sun orchid elixir.<br>
**Price** 750 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Ingested; **Attack** +6 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Wisdom; **Onset** 1 day; **Frequency** 1/day for 7 days<br>

*Type* Poison, Contact; **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Special; **Onset** 1 minute; **Frequency** 1/minute for 6 minutes<br>

## Mindrust
Refined from a traditional concoction first employed by winter witches, mindrust — or "witch's rust" as its northern creators know it — is a brownish, flaky concoction of condensed nightmare vapour, striped toadstools, and howler milk.<br>
**Price** 1,600 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Inhaled; **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Wisdom; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>
**Effect** A sentient creature becomes skittish and susceptible to suggestion for 1 minute. These minutes are cumulative; each time the creature is hit, its susceptibility to suggestion is extended by another minute. During that time, anyone can use the Intimidation skill as if it were the Persuasion skill to make a request of the creature. Additionally, spells from the enchantment school of magic have advantage to hit an affected creature while it is susceptible to suggestion. If this poison is neutralised, this susceptibility to suggestion also immediately ends.<br>
**Cure** 2 consecutive misses

It is used in a rite of passage in certain hunter-gatherer societies, where young men and women are given a dose of the poison and sent into the wild to hunt game and prove their worth, but it is also used as a punishment in some places, with the condemned being given several doses of the poison and then forced into the wild without any weapons or equipment.<br>

## Sweetdream
Often employed by spies and saboteurs, sweetdream is a potent sedative with useful amnesia-causing side effects. The memory loss is a mind-affecting effect. Victims of sweetdream often experience pleasant, fanciful dreams when affected by the poison’s secondary effect, a fact that both inspired the poison its name and contributed to its medicinal use among those plagued by nightmares or insomnia. Unlike similar drugs, sweetdream is not habit-forming, and thus users have no risk of developing a physiological addiction to the inhaled powder. However, once a frequent user becomes accustomed to the poison’s effects, he often finds himself unable to sleep without it, leading some authorities to ban its willing use.<br>

## Witch-Hunter’s Sword
This red fern has jagged, forward-pointing leaves and grows in small, close-packed groups. It is named for its popularity among witch hunters and inquisitors, and its leaves can be brewed into a tea that clouds the subject’s mind, interfering with the ability to cast spells while still leaving the subject lucid enough to be interrogated. The tea has a unique taste, which can be detected with a successful DC 20 Perception check. Attempts to disguise the taste require a poisoner's kit check opposed by the drinker’s Perception check. At the GM’s discretion, bonuses can be applied based on the ingredients used to mask the taste.<br>
