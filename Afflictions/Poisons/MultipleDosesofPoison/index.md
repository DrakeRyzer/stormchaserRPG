# Multiple Doses of Poison
Unlike other afflictions, multiple doses of the same poison "stack", meaning that successive doses combine to increase the poison’s DC and duration.

If the poison initially misses you, then stacking does not occur — the poison did not affect you and any later doses are treated independently. Likewise, if a poison has been cured or run its course (by you either being missed or outlasting the poison’s duration), stacking does not occur. However, if there is still poison active in you when you are attacked with that type of poison again, and you are hit by the new dose, the doses stack. This progresses the poison track by one step and increases the duration by 50%.

These increases are cumulative (a third dose adds another 1/2 to the duration and so on). When affected by multiple doses of the same poison, you are only attacked once when required by the frequency, rather than once for each dose of the poison.

Multiple doses do not alter the Cure condition of the Poison, and meeting that Cure condition ends all doses of the poison.

Applied contact poisons and injury poisons cannot inflict more than one dose of poison per weapon at a time (because the poison on the weapon only lasts for one successful attack before it wears off). Inhaled and ingested poisons can inflict multiple doses at once.

Doses from different poisons (such as an assassin with greenblood oil on his dagger and Medium spider venom on his short sword) do not stack — the effects of each are tracked separately.
