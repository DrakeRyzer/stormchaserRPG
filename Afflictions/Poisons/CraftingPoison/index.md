# Crafting Poison
You can make poison with the poisoner's kit. The DC to make a poison is equal to 10 its attack bonus. Rolling a natural 1 on a poisoner's kit check while making a poison exposes you to the poison. This does not consume the poison. If you have proficiency in poisoner's kits, you do not risk accidentally poisoning yourself when applying poison.
