# Infused Poisons
An infused poison combines the effects of an ingested poison and a potion. A creature drinking an infused poison is affected by the poison (and its initial effects or damage) first, after which the infused spell effect triggers and the imbiber is attacked a second time (often vs a different defence or with a different attack bonus) by its magical effects. Magic resistance applies normally to an infused poison’s magical effects, but offers no protection against the poison, and poison resistance offers no protection against the magical effects of an infused poison. Poison immunity renders a creature immune to an infused poison’s magical effects.

A poison can be infused with a spell of up to 3rd level that has a casting time of less than 1 minute and targets one or more creatures. As with a potion, you cannot create an infused poison unless you know the infused spell. The base price of the infusion is equal to the level of the spell × the creator’s caster level × 25 gp. The cost of the poison to be infused is paid separately. If the spell has a material component cost, it is added to the poison’s base price and cost of creation.

Infused poisons function like spells cast on the imbiber.

A poison’s creator makes all decisions regarding the spell’s effects when it is created — the creature consuming the infused poison has no control over its effects. Unlike with a potion, the imbiber is not considered the caster of the effect. If the spell has an effect related to the caster (as charm person does), the subject treats the first sentient creature it encounters after consuming the poison as the poison’s creator.

A character who attempts to identify an infused poison with a Perception check (as if it were a potion) has a 5% chance of poisoning herself, unless they have the poisoner's kit proficiency. This process doesn't consume the infused poison.

Infused poisons can be purchased at many black markets.
