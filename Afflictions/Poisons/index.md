# Poisons
A poison is a substance that interferes with the natural functions of a living creatureâ€™s body, causing injury or death, typically requiring only a very small amount. The poison must successfully attack one of the target's defences. Poisons can be delayed or cured with spells such as *protection from poison*.

Poisons have four categories, based on how they reach the target: *contact*, *ingested*, *inhaled*, or *injury*.

**Contact:** These poisons are delivered the moment a creature touches the poison with its bare skin. Such poisons can be used as injury poisons. Contact poisons usually have an onset time of 1 minute and a frequency of 1 minute.

**Ingested:** These poisons are delivered when a creature eats or drinks the poison. Ingested poisons usually have an onset time of 10 minutes and a frequency of 1 minute.

**Inhaled:** These poisons are delivered the moment a creature enters an area containing such poisons and do not usually have an onset time. For most inhaled poisons, 1 dose fills a volume equal to a 10-foot cube. A creature can attempt to hold its breath while inside the area to avoid inhaling the toxin. A creature holding its breath receives a 50% chance of not being attacked by the poison each round. See the rules for holding your breath and suffocation. If a creature is holding its breath and fails the constitution check to continue doing so, rather than suffocating it begins to breathe normally again (and is subject to the effects of the inhaled poison if still in the area).

**Injury:** These poisons are primarily delivered through the attacks of certain creatures and through weapons coated in the toxin. Injury poisons do not usually have an onset time and have a frequency of 1 round.
