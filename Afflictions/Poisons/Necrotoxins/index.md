# Necrotoxins
Necrotoxins fuse alchemy and necromancy to attack not just the body or the mind, but the very soul of the victim.

Charging necrotoxins with necrotic power requires special rituals, reagents from undead creatures, and the channeling of negative energy during the brewing process. The DC of the poisoner's kit check to brew a necrotoxin is 5 higher than the poison's DC due to the temperamental process of its creation.

## Entropic Dust
This white grit hinders a victim’s divine power.<br>
**Price** 1,500 gp; **Crafting Cost** 750 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Inhaled; **Attack** +8 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Charisma; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>
**Effect** Desecrate: For the duration of the poison, victim must succeed at a Constitution defence check vs 10 + the poison's attack bonus to channel divinity energy or lay on hands<br>

## Ghost Syrup
This necrotoxin causes a creature to lose corporeal substance.<br>
**Price** 6,000 gp; **Crafting Cost** 3,000 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Ingested; **Attack** +10 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Strength; **Onset** 1 minute; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>
**Effect** Ethereal Jaunt: Each round a victim takes damage from this poison, they have a 50% chance of dropping one held item. If a victim’s Strength is reduced to 0 by ghost syrup, the Strength damage becomes Strength drain, and the victim becomes permanently incorporeal. Carried and worn equipment is unaffected and remains corporeal, and the victim can be restored only through a limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.<br>
**Cure** 2 consecutive misses

## Lazurite Flakes
These dark gray flakes induce ravenous hunger.<br>
**Price** 5,400 gp; **Crafting Cost** 2,700 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Ingested; **Attack** +8 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Constitution; **Onset** 10 minutes; **Frequency** 1/minute for 8 minutes<br>
**Effect** Create Undead: A humanoid who dies while poisoned rises as an uncontrolled ghoul at the next midnight, retaining none of the abilities it possessed in life<br>

## Memento Mori
Memento mori is a powerful hallucinogen that clouds a victim’s senses with messages of death.<br>
**Price** 3,700 gp; **Crafting Cost** 1,850 gp<br>
**Type** Poison, Inhaled; **Attack** +9 vs Constitution Defence<br>
**Track** Wisdom; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds<br>
**Effect** Unhallow: As long as any Wisdom damage from the poison remains, the victim can’t distinguish living creatures from undead and can’t understand or read any language — spoken words sound like tearful moans and written words seem faded and tattered. While under this effect, the fear effects have advantage to hit the target and they must defend against all spells cast by others, even harmless or beneficial spells.<br>
**Cure** 2 consecutive misses

## Quick Rot
This smelly toxin causes a victim’s flesh to become gangrenous.<br>
**Price** 450 gp; **Crafting Cost** 225 gp<br>

**Track** Constitution; **Frequency** 1/round for 4 rounds<br>
**Effect** Ghoul Touch: Until the victim has recovered, they secrete an oily chemical that nearly every other creature finds offensive. Roll a poison attack vs the Constitution defence of all living creatures within 30 feet. On a hit, the creature is nauseated for 1d6+4 minutes. On a miss, the creature cannot be affected by the same creature’s stench for 24 hours. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal defensive bonus. The poisoned creature is not immune to its own stench<br>
**Cure** 1 miss
