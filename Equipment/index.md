# Equipment
The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts: dwarven smiths and elven woodcarvers, halfling farmers and gnomish jewelers, not to mention humans of every shape, size and colour drawn from a spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and practical swords.

For an adventurer, the availability of armour, weapons, backpacks, rope and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed wilds. This section details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the world presents.
