# Wearing Armour

## Equipment Sizes
A burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling's leather armour, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a cloud giant's elegant robe. Similarly, a suit of plate armour made for one human might not fit another without significant alterations and a guard's uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.
 
When adventurers find armour, clothing and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armoursmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The GM can either roll 1d4Ã—10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.

## Getting Into and Out of Armour

The time required to don or doff an armour piece is based on its type and the area that it protects.

**Don.** This is the time that it takes to put on the armour piece. You benefit from the armour's DR only if you take the full time to don the armour piece.

**Don Hastily.** This is the time that it takes to put on the armour piece in a hurry. The maximum Dexterity bonus and DR for hastily donned armour are each 1 point worse than normal (minimum 0 in the case of the DR).

**Doff.** This is the time it lakes to take off the armour piece.

If your species and class both grant proficiency in an armour category, you treat the armour as one category lighter for the purposes of donning and doffing.

When doffing armour or when donning medium armour, if a character has help, then this time is halved. A single character doing nothing else can help two adjacent creatures. Two characters can't help each other don or remove armour pieces at the same time. The wearer must have help to don heavy armour pieces. Without help, they can only be donned hastily.
