# Magic Items

## Attunement
A creature has 4 attunement slots. Magical items of common, uncommon and rare rarity consume one attunement slot, when attuned. Magical items of very rare, legendary and artifact rarity consume two attunement slots, when attuned.

## Identification
Identifying a magic item without the aid of the [identify](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Divination/#identify) spell (or similar magical assistance where appropriate) requires the use of the [identify magic](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Arcana/Identify/) action to ascertain the nature of a magic item by focusing on its aura and trying to decipher its glyphs and markings.

Note: Some powerful magic items might be recognisable with a [lore](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Lore/) check of a lower DC, but the [identify magic](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Arcana/Identify/) action to accurately identify all of their capabilities remains challenging.
