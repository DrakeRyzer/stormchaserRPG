# Magic Items

## Attunement
A creature has 4 attunement slots. Magical items of common, uncommon and rare rarity consume one attunement slot, when attuned. Magical items of very rare, legendary and artifact rarity consume two attunement slots, when attuned.

## Identification
Identifying a magic item without the aid of the identify spell (or similar magical assistance where appropriate) requires an arcana check to ascertain the nature of a magic item by focusing on its aura and trying to decipher its glyphs and markings. The DC is according to item rarity:

| Item Rarity | Arcana Check DC |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Common  | 10 |
|  Uncommon  | 15 |
|  Rare  | 20 |
|  Very Rare  | 25 |
|  Legendary  | 30 |

Note: Some powerful magic items might be recognisable with a history check of a lower DC, but the arcana check to accurately identify all of their capabilities remains challenging.
