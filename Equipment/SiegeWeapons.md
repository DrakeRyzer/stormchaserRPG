# Siege Weapons
These Siege Weapons rules recreate the brutal reality of siege weapon impact from a creature point of view. As such, damages are balanced towards realism and do not consider player survivability a priority. An impact with a siege weapon is intended to cause instant death or severe injuries beyond those of adventuring life. You have been warned!

In a campaign where siege warfare is essential, the GM should introduce Siege Weapon proficiency. Players can receive it as part of their background instead of another tool proficiency, or spend downtime days and gold to learn it.
