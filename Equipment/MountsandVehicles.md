# Mounts and Vehicles
A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Common Mounts and Pack Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity. Each of these animals costs 50% more if combat trained. A warhorse is already combat trained.

An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.

Mounts other than those listed here are available in the world, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.

**Barding.** Barding is armour designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armour shown on the Armour table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armour made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.

**Saddles.** A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.

**Vehicle Proficiency.** If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehic1e (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.

**Rowed Vessels.** Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.

## Other Creatures

### Aquatic Animals
Many of the following aquatic animals can be bought at seaside markets or from fisherfolk merchants out at sea. Pirates often make use of sharks, eels, and other nasty sea denizens when interrogating captured prisoners, searching for underwater traps, or retrieving sunken treasure. Some of the larger or rarer creatures, such as whales, are obviously much more difficult to find on the open market, and may only be available in seedy underground bazaars. Most aquatic animals can be trained as normal, though they are rarely sold already trained.

### Dinosaurs and Megafauna
The following animals are classified as either dinosaurs or megafauna, and garner a significantly higher price than most animals on the open market. The prices listed are for dinosaurs and megafauna that have been reared from birth in order to serve as pets or mounts. Combat-trained dinosaurs and megafauna are incredibly rare and have similarly extravagant costs (if one can even find a seller). Though not normally readily available, combat-trained dinosaurs and megafauna typically cost an amount equal to 1-1/2 × the price of the standard animal.

### Dire Animals
These feral beasts are all but untamable, and are typically only sought out by violent brawlers or cruel lords, either for brutish protection or to pit against equally vicious creatures in violent animal fights. At the GM’s discretion, PCs who acquire dire animals may be required to attempt Animal Handling checks every day to keep their pets from running away or attacking them and their allies. Dire animals are not generally suitable as mounts, though the GM may make exceptions at their discretion.

Whenever a party with an accompanying pet moves to a new scene in the adventure, somebody has to ask "What is [pet] doing?" Failure to do this means that the pet wanders off and upon realising this, a d20 must be rolled to determine what random event has happened.

| d20 | Pet Action |
|:---:|:----------:|
| 1 | The worst thing possible at that moment. |
| 2 | Eat something nearby<br>(could be just found, stolen or even poisonous). |
| 3 | Run off ahead<br>(if any traps are ahead then roll to avoid). |
| 4 | Looking for affection (PC or NPC). |
| 5 | Barks loudly (nearby creatures are alerted). |
| 6 | Finds somewhere to urinate. |
| 7 | Bites someone<br>(roll random target who the pet doesn't like). |
| 8 | Fetch an item with no value. |
| 9 | Perform a trick<br>(works as a performance check and can distract). |
| 10 | Runs around the area knocking things over<br>(has to be grabbed by someone). |
| 11 | Buries something (can be an unsecured inventory item or an item found/stolen nearby). |
| 12 | Fetch something of low value. |
| 13 | Run away from everyone (avoids creatures if it can). |
| 14 | Lick a stranger<br>(works as a persuade check to win someone over). |
| 15 | Find the nearest source of a drink<br>(does not need to be water). |
| 16 | Find some treasure<br>(could lead to a guarded treasure). |
| 17 | Hasn't gone anywhere, it is being well behaved. |
| 18 | Growls at somebody (works as an intimidate check). |
| 19 | Finds a plot hook (or successfully persuades/intimidates an NPC to get next hook). |
| 20 | Best possible event at that moment. |
