# Weapon Proficiency
Weapons are grouped into 11 categories.
* Axes
* Blades
* Bows
* Crossbows
* Firearms
* Flails
* Impact
* Improvised
* Polearms
* Simple
* Unarmed

Most people can use simple weapons effectively. These weapons include clubs, maces and other weapons that are often found in the hands of commoners.

Other weapon groups, such as axes, blades and polearms, require more specialised training. Most warriors use the weapons that put their fighting style and training to best use.

Training with a weapon allows you to roll with +1d when making an attack roll for any attack that you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add +1d to the attack roll.

If you are an expert with the weapon that you are wielding, you make attack rolls for that weapon with +2d. If you are a master with the weapon that you are wielding, you make attack rolls for that weapon with +3d.

The character point costs for weapon training, expertise and mastery are summarised in the following table:

| Benefit | Character Points |
|:-------:|:----------------:|
| Weapon Training | 2 |
| Weapon Expertise | 10 |
| Weapon Mastery | 25 |

You cannot purchase expertise in a weapon group, unless you are already trained with that weapon group. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to expert is 12 points.

You cannot purchase mastery in a weapon group, unless you are already an expert with that weapon group. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to master is 37 points.
