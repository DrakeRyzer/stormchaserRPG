# Weapon Proficiency
Your species, class and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapon groups or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and **martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, combat axes and halberds, require more specialised training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons, because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to roll an additional die of advantage when making an attack roll for any attack that you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency die to the attack roll.
