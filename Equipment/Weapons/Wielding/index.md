# Wielding Weapons

## Weapon Skill
Sometimes you must roll to contend with an enemy's weapon skill score. A creature only adds its proficiency bonus to its weapon skill if it is proficient with the weapon that it is wielding.

<strong>Weapon Skill = 10 + Proficiency + Strength Modifier<br>(or Dexterity Modifier, if wielding a Finesse weapon)</strong>

## Blocking With A Weapon
A weapon can be pushed beyond its limits, damaging it in the process. When you make a Strength defence check to block an attack, you may choose to brace your weapon against the threat. Your weapon takes the damage that the attack would deal to you (see [Interacting with Objects](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/InteractingWithObjects/#blocking-with-an-item)) and you benefit from advantage on the Strength defence check.

## Optical Scope
Firearms with ranges above 1000 feet require optical scopes for extreme range increments. Your weapon must have an optical or magical attachment costing a minimum of 100gp per 1000 feet increment beyond the natural limit of 1000 feet.

If you have not moved since the end of your last turn, you can use an action to aim down the scope of a firearm that has this trait at a specific target. Once you do so, you are incapacitated and your speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn. However, the first attack you make against the target at the start of your next turn can extend beyond the 1000 feet natural range, and ignore disadvantage on your attack roll from long range. 

## Lodged Arrows and Bullets
When you are hit by a ranged weapon using arrow projectiles and it causes you to suffer an injury, the arrow lodges deep into your body. Anytime you use your action during your turn with one or several lodged arrows in you, you take 1d4 piercing damage. Removing a lodged arrow is an action. You can use your action to remove the arrow, make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If you fail, the arrow breaks and the arrowhead remains in your body. 

When you are hit by a ranged weapon using bullet projectiles and it causes you to suffer an injury, the whole bullet or a fragment of it remains lodged in your body. Normal bullets leave one fragment while shot bullets leave 1d4 fragments. 
Having arrows or fragments of bullets in your body will elicit a foreign body reaction and become encapsulated by connective tissue unless removed. Until all fragments are removed, you always take the minimum roll amount of healing from restorative abilities, magical healing or using hit dice during rest.

To remove all fragments left by bullets in your body, you or an ally must spend one use of a Healer's Kit and make a Wisdom (Medicine) skill check at DC 10 + the number of lodged pieces lodged in your body (maximum DC 20). If the check fails, you can still remove any amount of fragments but you lose 1 hit point for each fragment removed. The manipulation takes 1 minute per fragment removed.

If you do not have Healer's Kit available, you can use a blade or even your fingers to attempt to remove fragments lodged in your body. If you choose to do so the DC is 12 + the number of fragments lodged in your body (maximum DC 20) and if you fail, you can remove any number of fragments but you lose 1d4 hit points for each fragment removed. The manipulation takes 2 minutes per fragment removed.
