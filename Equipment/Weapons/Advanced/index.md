# Advanced Weapons

## Special Materials
You can build a double weapon with each head made of a different special material.

### Adamantine
Adamantine is an ultra-hard metal found in extraordinary mineral veins. Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine. Weapons normally made of steel that are made out of adamantine have one-third more hit points than normal. Adamantine has 40 hit points per inch of thickness and DR 20 (see [substance DR and integrity](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/InteractingWithObjects/#substance-dr-and-integrity)).

Melee weapons made of adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an adamantine weapon hits an object, the hit is a critical hit. The adamantine version of a melee weapon costs 3000 gp more than the normal version.

### Mithril
Mithril is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than steel but just as hard. When worked like steel, it is occasionally used for weapons.

A weapon made from mithril costs an additional 500 gp per pound of weight in steel and weighs half as much. Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithril. Mithril weapons count as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and an unwieldy weapon made of mithril can make opportunity attacks even if the wielder took the attack action and used all of their attacks for that round. Additionally, the weapon's Str/Dex requirement is reduced by 2.

Mithril has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and DR 15.
