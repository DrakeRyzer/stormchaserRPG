# Siege Weapons
These Siege Weapons rules recreate the brutal reality of siege weapon impact from a creature point of view. As such, damages are balanced towards realism and do not consider player survivability a priority. An impact with a siege weapon is intended to cause instant death or severe injuries beyond those of adventuring life. You have been warned!

In a campaign where siege warfare is essential, the GM should introduce Siege Weapon proficiency. Players can receive it as part of their background instead of another tool proficiency, or spend downtime days and gold to learn it.

##### Siege Weapon Ammunition

| Ammo Type | Cost | Weapon Type & Effect |
|:----------|-----:|:--------------------:|
| Bolt | 6 sp/lb. | Impaling |
| Boulder | 2 sp/lb. | Crushing |
| Stone Cannonball | 2 gp/lb. | Explosive, Medieval |
| Iron Cannonball | 8 sp/lb. | Explosive, Renaissance |
| Burning | +50 gp | Target or area starts burning 1d6/round for rounds equal to weapon dice of attack. |
| Shrapnel | +100 gp | +3 to hit the Dexterity defence of creatures in AoE. A miss still deals half damage. |

## Siege Weapon Damage Types
Siege Weapons introduce three new types of damage: impaling, crushing and explosive. 

### Impaling <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/16/FFFFFF/archers-arrow.png">
Impaling damage is dealt by direct fire artillery such as the ballista. Their projectiles need to hit the target exactly to deal damage so they are best against immobile structures.

### Crushing <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/16/FFFFFF/naval-mine.png">
Crushing damage is dealt by indirect fire artillery such as the trebuchet. Their projectiles are large and bulky and threaten a small radius around the impact point. They can do damage to immobile structures even if they near miss, but creatures can attempt to evade to avoid any damage. 

### Explosive <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/16/FFFFFF/flash-bang-filled.png">
Explosive damage is dealt by gunpowder artillery such as the cannons. Their projectiles are shot at high velocity and they shatter and threaten a radius around the impact point. They can do damage to immobile structures even if they near miss, and creatures can attempt to evade to only take half damage.

## Structures and Materials
Structures made of solid material have Damage Reduction based on the material they are made from. Subtract DR from any damage dealt to them unless they are vulnerable to the damage type. Their size determines the base siege defence and the smaller the target is, the harder it is to hit.

| Material | Vulnerable To... | DR | Integrity/Foot |
|:---------|:----------------:|:--:|:-------:|
| Wood | Explosive, Impaling | 5 | 120 |
| Stone | Explosive, Crushing | 8 | 180 |
| Iron/Steel | — | 10 | 240 |

## Siege Weapon Properties

### Ammunition Weight
The ammunition caliber and weight (pounds per unit) are listed at the end of the siege weapon's name. 

### DR and Integrity
To make a melee or ranged attack against an immobile siege weapon you must make an attack roll of 10 or better. If you hit, subtract the siege weapon's DR from the damage and subtract the remaining damage from the siege weapon's integrity.

### Aim
To fire a loaded siege weapon, you must make an Intelligence (Siege Weapons proficiency) skill check. Add the Aim bonus or penalty of the weapon to your roll. 

### Range
Some siege weapons have three range values. The first value is the minimum range it can shoot at. The second and the third value are the Near and Long range. 

### Crew and Load
To load a siege weapon with a single unit of ammunition one or several creatures must commit a number of actions to clean and prepare the weapon to fire. Once actions equal to the load value are spent, the weapon is ready to fire. 

Only a limited number of creatures can work on a siege weapon together, up to the Crew value. 

### Size and Weight
Size category defines how massive the weapon is. Compact weapons can be lifted with two hands and shot like ranged weapons. Huge or Gargantuan weapons require special platforms to be moved around, or need to be assembled by skilled personnel. When mounting such weapons inside a vehicle (such as a ship) the vehicle will have a limited number of weapon slots of specific size.

The Weight is represented by a number of horses required to pull a cart containing the weapon and roughly equals a US tonne (2000 pounds). Values of 1/2 or 1/3 means multiple weapon can be transported with a single cart, and is limited to weapons Large or smaller. When the value is 2 or more, a wagon capable of being pulled by several animals is needed, or the weapon must be disassembled and parts of it carried by several carts. Huge creatures (i.e. elephants) count as two horses but require special carts or platforms. 

## Siege Weapon Actions

### Push/Move Weapon

When a siege weapon is built, assembled or placed stationary it is considered to be facing in a chosen direction (including diagonals). The weapon can only fire in that direction. Only if mounted on a mobile platform, vehicle or a living creature, its direction may change on command.

You can spend your action during combat to push or pull a siege weapon to change its direction of fire, or move it to a new position. To do this with a Large siege weapon you must have Strength score 13 or more and make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

For each size category above Large, raise minimum Strength score by +2 and DC by 5. The GM may allow you to roll with advantage if the weapon has means to rotate or move (such as wheels) or impose a disadvantage if has large friction area and stationary.

| Size | Strength | DC |
|:-----|:--------:|:--:|
| Medium | — | 15 |
| Large | 13 | 20 |
| Huge | 16 | 25
| Gargantuan | 19 | 30 |

A number of creatures that meet the Strength requirement can Help you, up to the Crew value of the siege weapon.

If you attempt to move to siege weapon and succeed, it can be moved up to half your speed if Large or smaller, or only by 5 feet if Huge. Gargantuan siege weapons cannot be moved without wheels, platforms or beasts of burden.

Once a siege weapon is moved or repositioned, it is no longer Aimed and all Aiming benefits are lost.

### Aim

Aiming involves precise targetting or trajectory calculation that improve the odds of hitting the target. To Aim a siege weapon during combat, spend your action to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Siege Weapon proficiency) check. Only one creature can Aim with the same siege weapon, up to a number of times equal to its Intelligence modifier. On success, an effect is applied to the next Fire action:

**Precise Targetting.** You gain advantage to the next Fire action with the siege weapon. This advantage ignores the general rule for only one advantage to the roll. You can take this option multiple times, each time adding one more d20 die to your next Fire action. 

**Predict Positioning.** When you fire a siege weapon that deals impaling or explosive damage against a target that moved during its previous turn (such as creature or a vehicle), you ignore defence bonuses from movement. Effect is ignored if the target chooses not to use its movement during any of its following turns prior the Fire action.

**Calculate Trajectory.** When you fire a siege weapon that deals crushing damage, it will ignore half and three quarters cover unless the cover is positioned above the target. 

**Collateral Damage.** When you fire a siege weapon that deals explosive damage, instead of doing collateral damage on missing the defence by 2 or less, you do so on missing the defence by 4 or less.

### Fire
Fire is either manual action or a given command to an ally who fires the siege weapon. Firing a siege weapon is not a ranged attack, and abilities and feats that benefit ranged attacks do not apply. After the weapon is fired, all Aiming benefits are lost. 

You can either spend your action to fire a siege weapon. Make a Dexterity or Intelligence (Siege Weapon proficiency) check and add the weapon's Aim modifier. You must meet or beat the siege defence of the target. 

The Aim action allows you to roll one or several extra d20 and take the highest result. You always hit if you roll more natural 20s than natural 1s with all dice. 

The siege defence of the target is based on its size, movement, or evasion ability. Use the tables to calculate the defence by choosing a base and applying related modifiers. 

##### Target Size Base Defence

| Size | Example | Base Defence |
|:-----|:-------:|:------------:|
| Medium | Humanoid, pile of munition | 25 |
| Large | Siege weapon, small tent | 20 |
| Huge | Single floor building | 15 |
| Gargantuan | Two or three floor building | 10 |
| Colossal | Temple, a large tower | 7 |
| Titanic | Large castle | 5 |

##### Target Mobility Modifier

| Speed | Example | Near Range | Long Range |
|:------|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Stationary | Any building | — | — |
| Slow <br>20 ft. or less | Moving siege weapon |+5 | +10 |
| Steady <br>30 ft. to 50 ft. | Squad of footmen |+10 | +15 |
| Fast 55ft. or more | Charging horsemen | +15 | +20 |

##### Target Armour Modifier

| Speed | Modifier | 
|:------|:--------:|
| For each 3 points of natural armour | +1 |
| For each 2 point Dexterity bonus to armour | +1 |

##### Cover Modifiers
For a structure or creature to benefit from cover, the cover should not be smaller than one size category below the size of the target.

| Cover | Visibility | Modifier | 
|:------|:----------:|:--------:|
| Half Cover | Night, fires illumination | +2 |
| Three Quarters Cover | Night, clear moon | +5 |
| Almost Total Cover | Night, cloudy | +10 |

## Damage Resolution

### Impaling <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/16/FFFFFF/archers-arrow.png">
Siege weapons that deal impaling damage do so only if your Fire check is equal or greater than the siege defence of the target.

### Crushing <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/16/FFFFFF/naval-mine.png">
Siege weapons that deal crushing damage cause damage to all targets in radius of their impact point. The size of the affected area is based on the number of damage dice.

#### Size of Impact Area

| Damage Dice | Radius, ft | 
|:------------|:----------:|
| 3–4 | 5ft. |
| 5–7 | 10ft. |
| 8–11 | 20ft. |
| 12–16 | 30ft. |
| 17–30 | 60ft. |
| 31+ | 120ft. |

Make an attack roll vs the Dexterity defence of all targets in the affected area. The attack bonus is based on the die size of the siege weapon (see table below). If the attack misses, the creature takes no damage.

| Die Size | Attack Bonus | 
|:---------|:-------:|
| d8 | +1 |
| d10 | +3 |
| d12 | +5 |
| d20 | +7 |

### Explosive <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/16/FFFFFF/flash-bang-filled.png">
Siege weapons that deal explosive damage cause damage to all targets in radius of their impact point. The size of the affected area and attack bonus are the same as those of siege weapons that deal crushing damage. However, creatures that are missed take half damage instead of no damage. 

Siege weapons that deal explosive damage also cause a lot of collateral damage. Even if the siege weapon misses the Dexterity defence by 2 or less, it still hits. However, structures take half damage and creatures that are missed take no damage.

## Siege Damage Injuries
For living creatures, a siege weapon impact is almost a death warrant. Not only you may die, but the prospects of finding remains of your body or being able to resurrected it may be uncertain.

If siege damage deals more than half your max stamina and reduces you to 0 stamina, you suffer a siege injury. Roll on the Siege Injury table. Roll with advantage if the damage is impaling. Roll with disadvantage if the damage is explosive. 

> ##### Strongholds & Followers
> These weapons are compatible with *Strongholds & Followers* by MCDM Productions. To convert to S&F, the Power Bonus is equal to the number of dice of the weapon damage.
