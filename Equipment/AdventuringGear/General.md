A backpack is a leather pack carried on the back, typically with straps to secure it.

* **Backpack, Common** This leather knapsack has one large pocket that closes with a buckled strap and holds about 2 cubic feet of material, or 30 pounds of equipment. Some may have one or more smaller pockets on the sides.
* **Backpack, Masterwork** This backpack has numerous pockets for storing items that might be needed while adventuring. Hooks are included for attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly. Like a common backpack, it can hold about 2 cubic feet of material in its main container, but is able to support up to 50 pounds of equipment. When wearing a masterwork backpack, treat your Strength score as +1 higher than normal when calculating your carrying capacity. A masterwork backpack requires an action to remove.
* **Backpack, Carrier** Reinforced metal bars allow for this leather backpack to withstand a greater degree of stress than a traditional pack. Along with the standard backpack compartment, this pack has an additional pouch and harness at its top. Used together, the harness and pouch can safely contain a Tiny or smaller creature. While harnessed, the creature can’t leave the backpack or see outside of it; it takes a full-round action to remove the harness from a carried creature.
* **Backpack, Hydration** This mostly leather backpack has a series of awkward metallic tubes, which run from the pack over your shoulders, and a small bladder at its base. A hydration backpack has a large pocket identical to that of a regular backpack that holds 2 cubic feet of material, while the bladder holds 1 gallon of liquid. The ends of the metal tubes can be positioned to allow you to easily dispense and drink liquid stored in the attached bladder. Consuming water in this way grants advantage on Constitution checks to avoid exhaustion while travelling.
* **Backpack, Weaponrack** This leather backpack includes a small weapons rack. The rack holds up to four weapons, such as battleaxes, broadswords, maces, or short swords. Allies adjacent to you can retrieve a weapon from the rack as if they were simply drawing a weapon. Like a normal backpack, it can hold 2 cubic feet of material in its main compartment.

## Crossbow Sling
**5 sp, — lb.** This light leather harness allows you to drop any weapon with the stock property and leave it hanging from your chest, instead of falling to the ground.

## Light Cloak
**5 gp, 1 lb.** Light cloaks let you hide your face, shape and the contents of your hands. You benefit from advantage to Dexterity (Stealth) and (Sleight of Hand) checks to hide your identity (but not your presence) or items you are carrying in your hands. As long as you wear no Bulky armour, you appear unarmoured to others. 

## Healer's Kit
**5 gp, 3 lb.** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

With a Healer's Kit you can also use the First Aid, Long Term Care and Resuscitate actions.

## Surgeon's Kit
**100 gp, 10 lb.** This Kit contains scalpels, scissors, saws, grasping forceps, and vials of alcohol. You must be proficient in Medicine to use a Surgeon's Kit. A Surgeon's Kit lets you use the First Aid action and benefit from advantage to the Wisdom (Medicine) check. Also, you can attempt the Perform Surgery and Resuscitate actions.

A Surgeon's Kit can be refilled with 10 uses for 40 gold.
