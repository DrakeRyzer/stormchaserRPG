# Trade Goods
Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).

Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.

## Special Materials
Items can be crafted using materials that possess innate special properties. If you make a suit of armour or weapon out of more than one special material, you get the benefit of only the most prevalent material.

### Mithril
Mithril is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than steel but just as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armour, and is occasionally used for other items as well.

An item made from mithril weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithril. Mithril weapons count as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Mithril has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 15.
