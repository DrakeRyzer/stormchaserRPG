# Vehicles
**Vehicle Proficiency.** If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.

## Drawn Vehicles
An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.

| Item | Cost | Weight |
|:----:|:----:|:------:|
| Carriage | 100 gp | 600 lb. |
| Cart | 15 gp | 200 lb. |
| Chariot | 250 gp | 100 lb. |
| Sled | 20 gp | 300 lb. |
| Wagon | 35 gp | 400 lb. |

## Waterborne Vehicles
**Rowed Vessels.** Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.

| Item | Cost | Speed |
|:----:|:----:|:-----:|
| Galley | 30,000 gp | 4 mph |
| Keelboat | 3,000 gp | 1 mph |
| Longship | 10,000 gp | 3 mph |
| Rowboat | 50 gp | l½ mph |
| Sailing ship | 10,000 gp | 2 mph |
| Warship | 25,000 gp | 2½ mph |
