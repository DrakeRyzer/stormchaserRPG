# Weapon Table Glossary

## Cost
The cost in gold pieces of the weapon.

## Damage
The damage dealt by the weapon.

## Properties

### Bashing
A weapon with the bashing property can also be used as a weapon with 5 foot reach, rolling the damage die shown in parenthesis.

### Brace
When a hostile creature enters the reach of a brace weapon after moving 10 feet or more, it must roll a defence check against an opportunity attack. If the creature fails the check, roll twice as many of the weapon's base damage dice.

### Brutal
A critical hit with a brutal weapons deals the listed number of additional weapon damage die.

### Cleave
When a melee attack with a cleave weapon reduces a creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack can carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points. 

### Close
If the target of an attack with a close weapon is grappled, double the number of weapon dice rolled for the attack's damage.

The close weapon property includes the effects of the finesse and light weapon properties.

### Concealed
Weapons with the Concealed property can be hidden from plain sight until wielded or used. You can use your Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) skill to hide the weapon.

### Critical
When a critical weapon scores a critical hit, the weapon damage dice deal their maximum damage.

### Disarm
Disarm attempts made with a disarm weapon are made with advantage.

### Double
A weapon with the double property has two striking ends. Attacks with the second end use the same damage die as the primary end and follow the rules for two-weapon fighting.

### Exotic
Exotic weapons are only considered martial weapons for a specific species. A character must spend a proficiency point to learn how to wield another species' exotic weapons effectively.

### Finesse
When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. If your Strength is less than the **Str/Dex** entry of the weapon, then you suffer disadvantage on your attack rolls with the weapon when using Dexterity in this way.

The light and close properties include the finesse property.

### Grappling
When you hit with a melee or thrown attack using a weapon with the Grappling property, you can spend your bonus action to attempt to grapple them. Make an attack roll vs the target's passive Dexterity (Acrobatics) skill. If you succeed, your weapon grapples the target. Other weapon properties (restrain, preventing, etc.) include this property and modify the grapple.

Whilst your weapon is grappling the target, any attack with the same weapon breaks the grapple. The grapple is broken if you or the target move out of reach. The grappled enemy can also spend an action and attempt a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your Weapon Skill DC. If it succeeds, the weapon grapple is broken. If it is not grappled by a thrown weapon, the target can also break the weapon grapple if it succeeds in disarming you.

Whilst your weapon is grappling the target and you are holding onto your weapon, you can attempt Shove a Creature action using your Attack roll instead of Strength (Athletics).

#### Break
The weapon has Strength defence and hp values and can be attacked with melee attacks as long as the weapon is grappling you (see grappling property). You may also be allowed a Strength check to break the weapon. Common breakable objects are:

* **Net.** Strength defence 10 and hp 5. Immune to bludgeoning and piercing damage. Can also be broken with a DC 23 Strength check. If the Net is Barbed, you take 1d4 piercing damage breaking it.
* **Bola or Lasso.** Strength defence 10 and hp 5. Immune to bludgeoning and piercing damage. Can also be broken with a DC 23 Strength check. 
* **Chain.** Strength defence 10 and hp 75. Immune to piercing damage. Takes no damage from attacks dealing 10 damage or less. Can also be broken with a DC 26 Strength check. 

Once broken, weapons immediately release their grapple and, unless held by you, drop to the ground.

#### Hooked
The weapon has a hooked head that can get stuck into your opponent. Whilst your weapon is grappling the target (see Grappling weapon property) and you are holding on your weapon, the target is unable to move away from you and can only approach you.

The target can only move away from you if it attempts to Shove you, or is Shoved away from you. If it succeeds, it also provokes an opportunity attack from you that automatically hits.

#### Ongoing
Whilst a weapon with the Ongoing property is grappling the target (see Grappling weapon property), the target takes damage at the beginning of each of its turns equal to the value shown in parenthesis. 

#### Preventing
Whilst your weapon is grappling the target (see Grappling weapon property) and you are holding your weapon, the target is unable to approach you and can only move away from you. 

The target can only move towards you if it attempts to Shove you. If it succeeds, it also provokes an opportunity attack from you that automatically hits. 

#### Restraining
Whilst your weapon is grappling the target (see grappling weapon property), the weapon restricts some of the actions of the creature. The effect depends on the location listed in parenthesis. If more than one is listed, pick one. If none are listed, pick any one of your choice.

* **All.** The creature is restrained by your weapon.
* **Body.** The creature is restrained by your weapon, except its speed is not reduced to 0.
* **Hand.** Choose a hand. The target cannot use that hand to attack or use items (unless activated) whilst restrained.
* **Legs**. The creature is restrained by your weapon, but it doesn't suffer disadvantage to attacks. If the creature used its movement in its turn before it was hit by this attack, it also falls prone.

Whilst your weapon is restraining the creature and you are holding your weapon, on your turn you may spend an attack to deal damage equal to your Strength modifier without rolling to attack. Creatures that are formless cannot be Restrained, and some creatures may be too large to Restrain, at GM discretion.

#### Suffocating
Whilst your weapon is grappling the target (see Grappling weapon property) and you are holding your weapon, the target is also suffocating. If the target attempts to break your weapon's grapple by moving out of reach, it must make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Weapon Skill DC. It can only move away from you if it succeeds on the check.

### Light
Light weapons are small and easy to handle, making them ideal for use when fighting with two weapons (see the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9).

A light weapon can also be used effectively while the wielder is prone or supine. Creatures that attack with a light weapon while prone or supine do not suffer disadvantage on their attack roll, if they are proficient with the weapon.

The light weapon property includes the effects of the finesse weapon property. The close weapon property includes the effects of the light weapon property.

### Long
Long weapons add 5 feet to your reach when you attack with them, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with them. However, long weapon attacks vs targets at a distance of 5 feet or less suffer disadvantage.

### Mounted
Mounted weapons deal additional damage when wielded by a creature riding a mount with a speed of 40 feet or more. The target may be neither prone, nor more than one one size category smaller than your mount. If the weapon has reach or is long, the target may be prone or two size categories smaller than your mount.

When rolling damage while mounted, double the number of weapon dice. Following a mounted attack, you may continue the movement of your mount and do not provoke an opportunity attack if you leave the reach of your target, unless your attack missed.

If a mounted weapon is two-handed, then it may be wielded in one hand when mounted.

### Non-Lethal
Non-lethal weapons are designed to incapacitate a target without killing it. Weapons with this property deal their full damage when dealing non-lethal damage.

### Parry
When wielding a parry weapon, you may add your proficiency modifier to your Strength defence vs melee attacks, if you are not already proficient in Strength defence. Your proficiency bonus to Strength defence vs melee attacks is limited by your weapon's size (see table below).

| Weapon Size | Maximum Bonus to Strength Defence |
|:-----------:|:---------------------------------:|
| Light | +1 |
| One-Handed | +3 |
| Two-Handed | +6 |

If you are wielding a finesse weapon and blocking an attack from a one-handed weapon, then you may use your Dexterity to calculate your Strength defence.

If you are wielding an unwieldy weapon and use all of your attacks when taking the attack action on your turn, then you do not benefit from the weapon's parry bonus to Strength defence until the end of your next turn.

### Reach
The weapon has an extended length. This weapon adds 5 feet to your Reach when you attack with it, and when determining your Reach for attacks of opportunity with it.

### Sharp
When you use a sharp weapon to attack a target with 4 or less DR, you ignore DR equal to the value listed.

### Shield
This two-handed weapon may be used in one hand when combined with a shield.

### Sunder
When you use a sunder weapon to attack a target with hard armour or natural armour with 7 or more DR, you ignore DR equal to the value listed.

### Tangle
Tangle weapons snare implements (arms, shields, weapons) used to directly block an attack made with them when defending via Strength defence. This entangles both the weapon used to make the attack and the implement used to defend. 

Attacks with an entangled weapon suffer disadvantage on the attack roll. An entangled shield grants no bonus to Strength defence and cannot be used to defend against ranged attacks. The wielder of the entangling weapon has advantage to disarm the entangled weapon.

The creature wielding the weapon used to make the attack can disentangle it using their object interaction. If the creature wielding the implement used to defend wishes to disentangle itself, then it must spend an attack as part of the attack action and make a successful melee attack roll vs the weapon skill of the creature wielding the entangling weapon.

### Trip
Trip attempts made with a trip weapon are made with advantage.

### Thrown
If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Drawing a Thrown weapon is part of the attack, but you need a free hand. You may use your bonus action to recover any Thrown weapon within your reach. At the end of combat, you can recover all undamaged Thrown weapons by taking up to a minute to search the battlefield.

When you are hit by a thrown weapon and it causes an injury, the weapon remains lodged in the target. Any time you use your action during your turn with one or several lodged weapons in you, you take 1d4 piercing damage. Removing a lodged weapon is an action.

### Two-Handed
A two-handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. When the weapon is held in two hands attempts to disarm you are made at disadvantage.

Wielding a melee weapon in two hands allows you to put more strength behind your blows. Your damage bonus increases by half (round up), as shown on the table below.

| Strength Modifier | Two-Handed Damage Bonus |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------:|
|  +1  | +2 |
|  +2  | +3 |
|  +3  | +5 |
|  +4  | +6 |
|  +5  | +8 |
|  +6  | +9 |
|  +7  | +11 |
|  +8  | +12 |

### Unwieldy
Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with unwieldy weapons. An unwieldy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

Additionally, if you take the attack action with an unwieldy weapon and use all of your attacks for that round, then hostile creatures leaving your reach do not have to make a defence check to avoid taking damage from an opportunity attack.

### Versatile
A versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. When the weapon is held in two hands attempts to disarm you are made at disadvantage.

Wielding a melee weapon in two hands allows you to put more strength behind your blows. Your damage bonus increases by 50%, as shown above on the two-handed weapon property table. Additionally, this damage bonus increases by a minimum of 1, see below:

| Strength Modifier | Two-Handed Damage Bonus |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| -5 | -4 |
| -4 | -3 |
| -3 | -2 |
| -2 | -1 |
| -1 | +0 |
| +0 | +1 |

### Vicious
Vicious weapons roll their damage die twice and take the better result.

### Worn
A worn weapon attaches to the arm but the hand remains unoccupied.

Weapons with the worn property are equipped similarly to armour, by strapping them firmly to the body. It takes up to 1 minute to don or doff the weapon and you can do it as part of donning or doffing armour. The GM may allow you to skip the required time if you ignore the worn property of the weapon.

While the weapon benefits from the worn property, it cannot be disarmed unless the attack or skill check is a critical hit.

## Str/Dex
If your Dexterity is less than the **Str/Dex** entry of the weapon, then you suffer disadvantage on your attack rolls with the weapon. If you are wielding the weapon as a finesse weapon, then this instead applies to your Strength.

## Weight
The weight of the weapon.
