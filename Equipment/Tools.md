# Tools
A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your species, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.

## Tools and Skills Together

### Advantage
If the use of a tool and the use of a skill both apply to a check, a character proficient in both makes the check with advantage. In the tool descriptions that follow, this benefit is often expressed as additional insight (or something similar), which translates into an increased chance that the check will be a success.

### Added Benefit
Characters who have both a relevant skill and a relevant tool proficiency gain an added benefit on a successful check. This benefit might be in the form of more detailed information, or could simulate the effect of a different sort of successful check. For example, a character proficient with mason’s tools makes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to find a secret door in a stone wall. Not only does the character notice the door’s presence, but you decide that the tool proficiency entitles the character to an automatic success on an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine how to open the door.

## Tool Descriptions

### Components
The first paragraph in each description gives details on what a set of supplies or tools is made up of. A character who is proficient with a tool knows how to use all of its component parts.

### Skills
Every tool potentially provides advantage on a check when used in conjunction with certain skills, provided a character is proficient with the tool and the skill. As GM, you can allow a character to make a check using the indicated skill with advantage. Paragraphs that begin with skill names discuss these possibilities. In each of these paragraphs, the benefits apply only to someone who has proficiency with the tool, not someone who simply owns it.

With respect to skills, the system is mildly abstract in terms of what a tool proficiency represents; essentially, it assumes that a character who has proficiency with a tool also has learned about facets of the trade or profession that are not necessarily associated with the use of the tool.

In addition, you can consider giving a character extra information or an added benefit on a skill check. The text provides some examples and ideas.

### Special Use
Proficiency with a tool usually has a particular special benefit, as described here.

### Sample DCs
A table at the end of each section lists activities that a tool can be used to perform, and suggested DCs for the necessary ability checks.

## Disguise Kit
The perfect tool for anyone who wants to engage in trickery, this pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props enables its owner to create disguises that change their physical appearance and adopt a false identiy. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.

**Components.** A disguise kit includes cosmetics, hair dye, small props, and a few pieces of clothing.

**Deception.** In certain cases, a disguise can improve your ability to weave convincing lies.

**Intimidation.** The right disguise can make you look more fearsome, whether you want to scare someone away by posing as a plague victim or intimidate a gang of thugs by taking the appearance of a bully.

**Performance.** A cunning disguise can enhance an audience’s enjoyment of a performance, provided the disguise is properly designed to evoke the desired reaction.

**Persuasion.** Folk tend to trust a person in uniform. If you disguise yourself as an authority figure, your efforts to persuade others are often more effective.

**Create Disguise.** As part of a long rest, you can create a disguise. It takes you 1 minute to don such a disguise once you have created it. You can carry only one such disguise on you at a time without drawing undue attention, unless you have a bag of holding or a similar method to keep them hidden. Each disguise weighs 1 pound.

At other times, it takes 10 minutes to craft a disguise that involves moderate changes to your appearance, and 30 minutes for one that requires more extensive changes.

**Arcana.** A forgery kit can be used in conjunction with the Arcana skill to determine if a magic item is real or fake.

**Deception.** A well-crafted forgery, such as papers proclaiming you to be a noble or a writ that grants you safe passage, can lend credence to a lie.

**History.** A forgery kit combined with your knowledge of history improves your ability to create fake historical documents or to tell if an old document is authentic.

**Investigation.** When you examine objects, proficiency with a forgery kit is useful for determining how an object was made and whether it is genuine.
