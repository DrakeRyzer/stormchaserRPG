# Herbalism Kit
This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. The kit has ten uses. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs and to safely collect their useful elements. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and potion of healing.

**Components.** An herbalism kit includes pouches to store herbs, clippers and leather gloves for collecting plants, a mortar and pestle, and several glass jars.

**Arcana.** Your knowledge of the nature and uses of herbs can add insight to your magical studies that deal with plants and your attempts to identify potions.

**Investigation.** When you inspect an area overgrown with plants, your proficiency can help you pick out details and clues that others might miss.

**Medicine.** Your mastery of herbalism improves your ability to treat illnesses and wounds by augmenting your methods of care with medicinal plants. With a Herbalist's Kit you can also use the Treat Poison and Treat Disease actions.

**Nature and Survival.** When you travel in the wild, your skill in herbalism makes it easier to identify plants and spot sources of food that others might overlook. You can refill one use of the Herbalist Kit with a Wisdom (Survival) check gathering herbs from their environment, with the DC based on their availability.

**Identify Plants.** You can identify most plants with a quick inspection of their appearance and smell.
