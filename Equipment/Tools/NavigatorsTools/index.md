# Navigator's Tools
This set of instruments is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator's tools lets you chart a ship's course, follow navigation charts and helps you to determine a true course based on observing the stars. It also grants you insight into charts and maps while developing your sense of direction. In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at sea.

**Components.** Navigator’s tools include a sextant, a compass, calipers, a ruler, parchment, ink, and a quill.

**Survival.** Knowledge of navigator’s tools helps you avoid becoming lost and also grants you insight into the most likely location for roads and settlements.

**Sighting.** By taking careful measurements, you can determine your position on a nautical chart and the time of day.
