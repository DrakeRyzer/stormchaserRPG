# Runes
Some magic weapons and armour gain their enhancements from potent runes etched into them.

Runes must be physically engraved on items through a special process to convey their effects. They take two forms: fundamental runes and property runes. Fundamental runes offer the most basic and essential benefits: a *weapon potency* rune adds a bonus to a weapon's attack rolls, and the *striking* rune adds extra weapon damage dice. An *armour potency* rune increases the armour's bonus to DR, and the *resilient* rune grants a bonus to the wearer's defences. Property runes, by contrast, grant more varied effects - typically powers that are constant while the armour is worn or that take effect each time the weapon is used, such as a rune that grants energy resistance or one that adds fire damage to a weapon’s attacks. 

The number of property runes a weapon or armour can have is equal to the value of its *potency* rune. A +1 weapon can have one property rune, but it could hold another if the +1 *weapon potency* rune were upgraded to a +2 *weapon potency* rune. Since the *striking* and *resilient* runes are fundamental runes, they don’t count against this limit. You must attune to a runed item to benefit from its magic.

Runed armour and weapons have the same general characteristics as the non-magical version unless noted otherwise. Each rune can be etched into a specific type of armour or weapon, as indicated in the Usage entry of the rune's stat block. Clothing can have armour runes etched on it even though it's not armour, but because it's not in the light, medium, or heavy armour category, it can't have runes requiring any of those categories.

## Runic Script
Scripts are instructions for etching runes. You can usually read a script as long as you can read the language it’s written in, though you might lack the skill to craft the item.

You can buy scripts at the price listed in the Script Price table below, or you can hire an NPC to let you copy their formula for the same price. A purchased script is typically a schematic on rolled-up parchment. You can copy a a script in 1 hour.

If you have a runed item, you can try to reverse engineer its script. This takes the same amount of time as creating the item from a script would. You attempt a crafting check against the same DC it would take to craft the item. If you succeed, you craft the script at its full price. You can work for longer in order to reduce the price.

#### The Etching Process
Etching a rune on an item follows the same process crafting an item. You must have the script for the rune, the item you're adding the rune to must be in your possession throughout the etching process, and you must meet any special crafting requirements of the rune. The rune has no effect until crafting is complete. You can etch only one rune at a time.

You can upgrade a rune already etched on a suit of armour to a stronger version, increasing the values of the existing rune to those of the new rune. You must have the script of the stronger rune to do so, and the price of the upgrade is the difference between the two runes' prices.

##### Script Price

| Rune Level | Script Price | Rune Level | Script Price |
|:----------:|:------------:|:----------:|:------------:|
| 1 | 10 gp | 11 | 700 gp |
| 2 | 20 gp | 12 | 1000 gp |
| 3 | 30 gp | 13 | 1500 gp |
| 4 | 50 gp | 14 | 2250 gp |
| 5 | 80 gp | 15 | 3250 gp |
| 6 | 130 gp | 16 | 5000 gp |
| 7 | 180 gp | 17 | 7500 gp |
| 8 | 250 gp | 18 | 12000 gp |
| 9 | 350 gp | 19 | 20000 gp |
| 10 | 500 gp | 20 | 35000 gp |

## Transferring Runes
You can transfer runes between one item and another, including a runestone. This lets you either move one rune from one item to another or swap a rune on one item with a rune on the other item. To swap, the runes must be of the same form (fundamental or property).

If an item can have two or more property runes, you decide which runes to swap and which to leave when transferring. If you attempt to transfer a rune to an item that can’t accept it, such as transferring a melee weapon rune to a ranged weapon, you automatically failure your crafting check. If you transfer a potency rune, you might end up with property runes on an item that can’t benefit from them. These property runes go dormant until transferred to an item with the necessary potency rune or until you etch the appropriate potency rune on the item bearing them.

The DC of the Crafting check to transfer a rune is determined by the item level of the rune being transferred, and the Price of the transfer is 10% of the rune’s Price, unless transferring from a runestone, which is free. If you're swapping, use the higher level and higher Price between the two runes to determine these values. It takes 1 day to transfer a rune or swap a pair of runes, and you can continue to work over additional days to get a discount.

## Fundamental Runes
Four fundamental runes produce the most essential magic of protection and destruction: armour potency and resilient runes for armour, and weapon potency and striking runes for weapons. A potency rune is what makes weapons and armour magical. An item can have only one fundamental rune of each type, though etching a stronger rune can upgrade an existing rune to the more powerful version.

##### Fundamental Runes

| Rune | Item | Benefit |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|
| Potency | Armour | Bonus to DR and property runes |
| Resilient | Armour | Defence bonus |
| Potency | Weapon | Attack bonus and property runes |
| Striking | Weapon | Bonus weapon damage dice |

### Armour Potency
Magic wards deflect attacks, granting a bonus to armour DR.

| Type | Bonus | Rune Level | Price |
|-----:|------:|-----------:|------:|
| Standard | +1 | 5 | 1500 gp |
| Greater |+2 | 11 | 6000 gp |
| Major | +3 | 18 | 24000 gp |

### Resilient
*Resilient* runes imbue armour with additional protective magic, granting the wearer a bonus to defences.

| Type | Bonus | Rune Level | Price |
|-----:|------:|-----------:|------:|
| Standard | +1 | 8 | 3000 gp |
| Greater | +2 | 14 | 12000 gp |

### Weapon Potency
Magical enhancements make this weapon strike true, granting a bonus to attack rolls with this weapon. Potency runes cannot be etched upon ammunition.

| Type | Bonus | Rune Level | Price |
|-----:|------:|-----------:|------:|
| Standard | +1 | 2 | 1000 gp |
| Greater | +2 | 10 | 4000 gp |
| Major | +3 | 16 | 16000 gp |

### Striking
A *striking* rune stores destructive magic in the weapon, increasing the number of weapon damage dice. For example, a +1 striking broad sword would deal 4d4 damage instead of 2d4 damage. Striking runes cannot be etched upon ranged weapons that use ammunition.

| Type | Dice Multiplier | Rune Level | Price |
|-----:|----------------:|-----------:|------:|
| Standard | x2 | 4 | 2000 gp |
| Greater | x3 | 12 | 8000 gp |
| Major | x4 | 19 | 32000 gp |

## Property Runes
Property runes add special abilities to armour or a weapon in addition to the item's fundamental runes. If a suit of armour or a weapon has multiple etchings of the same rune, only the highest-level one applies. You can upgrade a property rune to a higher-level type of that rune in the same way you would upgrade a fundamental rune.

### Armour Property Runes

#### Shadow

The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armour.

<br>**Level:** 8
<br>**Price:** 6000 gp

These symbols convey protective forces from the Elemental Planes. You gain resistance to acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The crafter chooses the damage type when creating the rune.

Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it. Following this, make an attack roll with a +5 bonus vs the creature's Constitution defence. On a miss, the effect of all such wounds end. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

#### Corrosive
**Usage:** Etched onto a weapon.

Acid sizzles across the surface of the weapon. When you hit with the weapon, add 1d6 acid damage to the damage dealt. In addition, on a critical hit, the target’s armour (if any) takes 3d6 acid damage. If the target has a shield, the shield takes this damage instead.

#### Dancing
**Usage:** Etched onto a melee weapon.
<br>**Level:** 13
<br>**Price:** 2000 gp

A *dancing* weapon flies autonomously and strikes your foes. You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.

While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.

After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.

#### Spell-Storing
**Usage:** Etched onto a melee weapon.
<br>**Level:** 13
<br>**Price:** 24000 gp

A *spell-storing* rune creates a reservoir of eldritch energy within the etched weapon. This weapon stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The weapon can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6−1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the weapon by touching the weapon as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the weapon can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While wielding this weapon, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the weapon is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

If you hit and damage a creature with this weapon, you may unleash a stored spell, which uses the target of the triggering attack as the target of the spell. If the spell requires a spell attack roll, it automatically hits.

#### Sharpness
**Usage:** Etched onto a slashing melee weapon.
<br>**Level:** 13
<br>**Price:** 1700 gp

When you attack an object with this magic weapon and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

#### Speed
**Usage:** Etched onto a piercing or slashing melee weapon.
<br>**Level:** 16
<br>**Price:** 2000 gp

You can make one attack with this weapon as a bonus action on each of your turns.

#### Vorpal
**Usage:** Etched onto a slashing melee weapon.
<br>**Level:** 17
<br>**Price:** 24000 gp

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.
