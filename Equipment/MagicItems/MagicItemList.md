# Magic Item List

## Mithril Armour
*Armour (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon.<br>Cost: 800 gp.*

Mithril is a light, flexible metal. A mithril chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes.

If the armour normally imposes disadvantage physical ability checks, or has a Strength requirement, the mithril version of the armour does not. Furthermore, mithril armour weighs half as much as normal armour of that type, and counts as one category lighter for purposes other than proficiency. For example, a barbarian may benefit from rage while wearing mithril full plate, but must be proficient in heavy armour to do so. When using the Realistic Armour rules, mithril armour is not bulky or noisy.

## Potion of Healing
*Potion, common*

You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number depends on the potion's rarity and your hit die, as shown in the **Potions of Healing** table. When rolling hit die, use the die size that your character has the most levels with. When two die sizes are tied, take the larger.

##### Potions of Healing

| Potion of ... | Rarity | Hit Points Restored |
|:-------------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|
| Healing | Common | 2 HD |
| Greater Healing | Uncommon | 4 HD |
| Superior Healing | Rare | 8 HD |
| Supreme Healing | Very Rare | 10 HD |

## Potion of Healing, Shifty
*Potion, common (10 gp)*

When you drink this potion, roll a d20. The effect depends on your roll, as shown on the Potion Effects table.

##### Potion Effects
| d20 Roll | Potion Effect |
|:--------:|:--------------|
| 1 | Take 4 HD poison damage. |
| 2-4 | Take 2 HD poison damage. |
| 5-9 | Take 1 HD poison damage. |
| 10-11 | Roll on the wild magic surge table. |
| 12-16 | Heal 2 HD. |
| 17-19 | Heal 4 HD. |
| 20 | Heal 8 HD. |

## Scroll of Telescription
*Scroll, uncommon.*<br>
*Cost: 160 to 200 gp per charge.*

Also known as a 'fire message', this magical scroll of parchment can be used to send written messages.

Write a message upon the *Scroll of Telescription*, while concentrating on the name, image, or identity of a creature with which you are familiar. Upon completion of message, the *Scroll of Telescription* will begin to burn from one end until it is consumed and evaporates into fine ashes. A flame will appear in the air in front of the recipient creature and slowly 'burn' in reverse until the entire piece of parchment has appeared. If not caught in the air it will then fall slowly to the ground. Once sent, the parchment loses its magic.

Scrolls of Telescription are typically sold in rolls of 10 charges and each charge can send a short message of twenty-five words or less. Multiple charges may be combined for a single longer message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.

## Spell Scrolls
Any character can use a spell scroll, provided they have a spellcasting ability equal to 10 + the spell's level.

A creature who tries and fails to cast a spell from a spell scroll must make a DC 10 Intelligence check. If the creature is proficient in Intelligence defence, it may add its proficiency bonus to this check. If the check fails, roll on the Scroll Mishap table.

##### Scroll Mishap

| d6  | Result |
|:---:|:-------|
|  1  | A surge of magical energy deals the caster 1d6 force damage per level of the spell. |
|  2  | The spell affects the caster or an ally (determined randomly) instead of the intended target, or it affects a random target nearby if the caster was the intended target. |
|  3  | The spell affects a random location within the spell's range. |
|  4  | The spell's effect is contrary to its normal one, but neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, a fireball might produce an area of harmless cold. |
|  5  | The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect related to the spell. Such effects last only as long as the original spell's duration, or 1d10 minutes for spells that take effect instantaneously. For example, a fireball might cause smoke to billow from the caster's ears for 1d10 minutes. |
|  6  | The spell activates after 1d12 hours. If the caster was the intended target, the spell takes effect normally. If the caster was not the intended target, the spell goes off in the general direction of the intended target, up to the spell 's maximum range, if the target has moved away. |
Scribing a spell scroll takes 1 hour for each level of the spell.
