# Animals
The prices for animals are listed both for renting and for purchasing them outright. You usually need to pay for animal rentals up front and, if the vendor believes that the animal might be put in danger, they typically require a deposit equal to the purchase price. Most animals panic in battle. When combat begins, they become frightened 4 and fleeing as long as they’re frightened. If you successfully [Command your Animal]() using [Nature](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Nature/), then you can keep it from fleeing, although this doesn’t remove its frightened condition. If the animal is attacked or damaged, it returns to frightened 4 and fleeing, with the same exceptions.

Warhorses and warponies are combat trained. They don’t become frightened or fleeing during encounters in this way.

Statistics for the animals appear in the [Bestiary](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Bestiary/).

## Barding
You can purchase special armour for animals, called barding. All animals have a trained proficiency rank in light barding and combat-trained animals are trained in heavy barding. Barding uses the same rules as armour except for the following. The price and bulk of barding depend on the animal’s size. Unlike for a suit of armour, barding’s Strength entry is listed as a modifier, not a score. Barding can’t be etched with magic runes, though special magical barding might be available.
