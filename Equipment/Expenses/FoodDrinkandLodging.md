## Intoxication
One unit of alcohol is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_alcohol "Wikipedia: Unit of Alcohol") as 10 milliliters of pure alcohol. Typical drinks (i.e., typical quantities or servings of common alcoholic beverages) may contain 1–3 units of alcohol. Typically, there is one unit per half-pint of beer, or small glass of wine, or single measure of spirits. Most drinks, such as a pint of beer/ale, or a normal-sized glass of wine, is assumed to contain 2 units.

Drinking alcohol provokes a Constitution defence check, with a DC of 2 per unit in the drinker's system. This is cumulative, so the DC for drinking two pints of beer, or 4 units of alcohol, is DC 8.

The drinker's Constitution defence is considered their base alcohol tolerance. Until the DC exceeds this number, the drinker suffers no ill effects. This number will be 10 for the average commoner - they can comfortably drink two pints without a problem. A particularly fit individual with 12 Constitution defence can drink 3 pints, or 12 units of alcohol, before suffering penalties.

Once the DC of the consumed alcohol exceed the drinker's Constitution defence, the drinker suffers one level of exhaustion. If they consume any further alcohol, they roll against the DC normally. Failed checks result in additional levels of exhaustion. If the drinker reaches the 6 levels of exhaustion as a result of drinking, they do not die, but instead pass out and are unconscious, but stable. The lethal dose of alcohol is 30 units plus the drinker's Constitution score.

Alchohol is considered poison and resistance to poison grants resistance on any Constitution checks against alcohol. This equates to a +4 bonus to the drinker's base tolerance.

As an approximate guideline, a typical healthy human adult can metabolise (break down) 1 unit of alcohol per hour, although this may vary depending on gender, age, weight, health and many other factors. These factors are summarised by the drinker's Constitution score. A drinker breaks down one tenth of their Constitution score in units of alcohol per hour. Once the alcohol has left their system, the levels of exhaustion are removed.
