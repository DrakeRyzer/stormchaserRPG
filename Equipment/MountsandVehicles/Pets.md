Whenever a party with an accompanying pet moves to a new scene in the adventure, somebody has to ask "What is [pet] doing?" Failure to do this means that the pet wanders off and upon realising this, a d20 must be rolled to determine what random event has happened.

| d20 | Pet Action |
|:---:|:----------:|
| 1 | The worst thing possible at that moment. |
| 2 | Eat something nearby<br>(could be just found, stolen or even poisonous). |
| 3 | Run off ahead<br>(if any traps are ahead then roll to avoid). |
| 4 | Looking for affection (PC or NPC). |
| 5 | Barks loudly (nearby creatures are alerted). |
| 6 | Finds somewhere to urinate. |
| 7 | Bites someone<br>(roll random target who the pet doesn't like). |
| 8 | Fetch an item with no value. |
| 9 | Perform a trick<br>(works as a performance check and can distract). |
| 10 | Runs around the area knocking things over<br>(has to be grabbed by someone). |
| 11 | Buries something (can be an unsecured inventory item or an item found/stolen nearby). |
| 12 | Fetch something of low value. |
| 13 | Run away from everyone (avoids creatures if it can). |
| 14 | Lick a stranger<br>(works as a persuade check to win someone over). |
| 15 | Find the nearest source of a drink<br>(does not need to be water). |
| 16 | Find some treasure<br>(could lead to a guarded treasure). |
| 17 | Hasn't gone anywhere, it is being well behaved. |
| 18 | Growls at somebody (works as an intimidate check). |
| 19 | Finds a plot hook (or successfully persuades/intimidates an NPC to get next hook). |
| 20 | Best possible event at that moment. |
