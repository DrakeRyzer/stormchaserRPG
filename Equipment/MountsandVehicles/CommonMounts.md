# Common Mounts
A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Common Mounts and Pack Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity. Each of these animals costs 50% more if combat trained. A warhorse is already combat trained.

##### Common Mounts and Pack Animals

| Item | Cost | Speed | Carrying Capacity |
|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| Camel | 50 gp | 50 ft. | 480 lb. |
| Donkey or mule | 8 gp | 40 ft. | 420 lb. |
| Elephant | 200 gp | 40 ft. | 1,320 lb. |
| Horse, draft | 50 gp | 40 ft. | 540 lb. |
| Horse, riding | 75 gp | 60 ft. | 480 lb. |
| Mastiff | 25 gp | 40 ft. | 195 lb. |
| Pony | 30 gp | 40 ft. | 225 lb. |
| Warhorse | 400 gp | 60 ft. | 540 lb. |

Mounts other than those listed here are available in the world, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.

## Mount Equipment

**Barding.** Barding is armour designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armour shown on the Armour table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armour made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.

**Saddles.** A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.
