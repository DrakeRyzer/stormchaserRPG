# Armour and Shields
The world is a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armour types, ranging from leather armour to chain mail to costly plate armour, with several other kinds of armour in between. The armour tables collect the most commonly available types of armour found in the game and separates them into three categories: light, medium and heavy. Many warriors supplement their armour with a shield.

The armour tables show the cost, weight and other properties of the common types of armour worn in Arden.

Damage types are represented by icons: <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/12/FFFFFF/thor-hammer.png"> for bludgeoning, <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/12/FFFFFF/archer-filled.png"> for piercing and <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/12/FFFFFF/sword-filled.png"> for slashing damage.
