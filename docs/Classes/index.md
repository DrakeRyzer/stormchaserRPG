# Classes
Heroes seek gold, glory, justice, fame, influence and knowledge, among other goals. Some of these goals are honourable, some base. Each character chooses a different way to achieve these goals, from brutal combat power to subtle skills to mastery of magic. Some adventurers prevail and grow in experience, wealth and power. Others die.

A character class is the frame upon which you build your hero. It isn't meant to be rigid or confining. Instead, a class provides a starting point from which you can develop in any direction that you see fit. Don't think of a class as restrictive; instead a class is defining. When you choose a class for your character, you're laying the foundation of a concept that will grow and expand as you play. A class provides structure. How you develop your character is entirely up to you. You get to choose talents and feats as you advance and you can take levels in other classes as you go along if that better serves the concept at the core of your hero.

## Choosing a Class
Three classes are available in the *Stormchaser Roleplaying Game*. At 1st level, you must choose a class for your character. The three classes are:
* **Expert** 
* **Spellcaster**
* **Warrior:**

## The Multiclass Character
As your character advances in level, he or she may take levels in other classes. Taking a level in a new class gives the character a broader range of abilities, but all advancement in the new class is at the expense of advancement in the character's other class or classes. For example, an expert might become an expert/warrior. Taking a level in the warrior class would give them proficiency in more weapons and so on, but it would also mean that they don't gain new expert talents and thus are not as powerful an expert as they otherwise would have become. Rules for creating and advancing multiclass characters can be found at the end of this chapter.

> ### Class Level vs. Character Level
> The *Stormchaser Roleplaying Game* uses the terms *class level* and *character level* to mean different things. Class level pertains to a character's level in a particular class. Character level pertains to a character's total experience. So, a character who has only one class has a character level and class level that are the same. (A 7th level spellcaster has a character level of 7th and a class level of 7th.) However, for a character with more than one class, class level and character level are different. A 4th level warrior/3rd level expert has a character level of 7th, with a warrior class level of 4th and an expert class level of 3rd.

## Class Descriptions
The rest of this chapter, up to the section on multiclass characters, describes each class. These descriptions are general. Individual members of a class may differ in their attitudes, outlooks and other aspects.
