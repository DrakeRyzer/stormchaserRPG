# Inspiration
Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.

## Gaining Inspiration
Your GM can choose to award the party inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when a player plays out their character's personality traits, gives in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portrays their character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game. Examples include:
* Great roleplaying moments, deep storytelling with dramatic effect, rich detail in describing combat.
* Working together as a team to overcome extraordinary odds, defeating difficult opponents, and progressing the story when it is not openly directed by the GM.
* Creating a dramatic moment important to their character, or contributing to an important scene involving other player characters that advances their development.

Additionally, you can reward another player for inspiration, due to good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, nominate that character for inspiration.

The party can store points up to the number of players in the group.

## Using Inspiration
Any player in the party can spend inspiration at any time to:
* Increase one player’s initiative by +10 for one combat
* Remove one failed death save
* Reroll a single damage roll rolled by a player or the GM.
* Reroll one attack roll or skill check by a player and choose between the two results.
* Have the GM roll twice when rolling on a random effect table and the party chooses one of the possible results.

A character may reroll a single die roll using inspiration a maximum number of times equal to their proficiency bonus.
