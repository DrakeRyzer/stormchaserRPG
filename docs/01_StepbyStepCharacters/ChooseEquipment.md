# 5. Choose Equipment

Your class and background determine your characterâ€™s **starting equipment**, including weapons, armour and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5.

Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of **gold pieces** (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown in chapter 5. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost (see the "Trinkets" table at the end of chapter 5).

Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity.

## Armour
Armour grants **Damage Reduction** (DR), which represents how well protected your character is. However, not all characters wear armour.

Your character needs to be proficient with armour to wear and use it effectively. Your armour proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armour if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in chapter 5.

## Weapons
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.

When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.

* For attacks with **melee weapons**, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.
* For attacks with **ranged weapons**, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee weapon that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use your Strength modifier instead.
