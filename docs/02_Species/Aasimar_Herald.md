# Herald Aasimar

## Ability Score Increase
Your Dexterity score rises by 1.

## Radiant Mobility
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to glimmer and your feet to glide on waves of divine light.

Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you have a speed of 60 feet, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level.

Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
