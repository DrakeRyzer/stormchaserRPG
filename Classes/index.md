# Classes
Heroes seek gold, glory, justice, fame, influence and knowledge, among other goals. Some of these goals are honourable, some base. Each character chooses a different way to achieve these goals, from brutal combat power to subtle skills to mastery of magic. Some adventurers prevail and grow in experience, wealth and power. Others die.

A character class is the frame upon which you build your hero. It isn't meant to be rigid or confining. Instead, a class provides a starting point from which you can develop in any direction that you see fit. Don't think of a class as restrictive; instead a class is defining. When you choose a class for your character, you're laying the foundation of a concept that will grow and expand as you play. A class provides structure. How you develop your character is entirely up to you. You get to choose talents and feats as you advance and you can take levels in other classes as you go along if that better serves the concept at the core of your hero.
