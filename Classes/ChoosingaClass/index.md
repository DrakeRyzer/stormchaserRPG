# Choosing a Class
Four classes are available in the *Stormchaser Roleplaying Game*. When you create your character, you must choose a class for them. The four classes are:
* **Expert** 
* **Mage**
* **Priest**
* **Warrior**

## Multiclassing
As your character advances, he or she may take talents from other classes. Taking a talent from a new class gives the character a broader range of abilities, but all advancement in the new class is at the expense of advancement in the character's other class or classes. For example, an expert might become an expert/warrior. Taking a talent from the warrior class would give them proficiency in more weapons and so on, but it would also mean that they don't gain new expert talents and thus are not as powerful an expert as they otherwise would have become. Rules for creating and advancing multiclass characters can be found at the end of this section.
