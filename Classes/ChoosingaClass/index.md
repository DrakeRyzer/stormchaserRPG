# Choosing a Class
Three classes are available in the *Stormchaser Roleplaying Game*. At 1st level, you must choose a class for your character. The three classes are:
* **Expert** 
* **Mage**
* **Warrior:**

## Multiclassing
As your character advances in level, he or she may take levels in other classes. Taking a level in a new class gives the character a broader range of abilities, but all advancement in the new class is at the expense of advancement in the character's other class or classes. For example, an expert might become an expert/warrior. Taking a level in the warrior class would give them proficiency in more weapons and so on, but it would also mean that they don't gain new expert talents and thus are not as powerful an expert as they otherwise would have become. Rules for creating and advancing multiclass characters can be found at the end of this chapter.

> ### Class Level vs. Character Level
> The *Stormchaser Roleplaying Game* uses the terms *class level* and *character level* to mean different things. Class level pertains to a character's level in a particular class. Character level pertains to a character's total experience. So, a character who has only one class has a character level and class level that are the same. (A 7th level spellcaster has a character level of 7th and a class level of 7th.) However, for a character with more than one class, class level and character level are different. A 4th level warrior/3rd level expert has a character level of 7th, with a warrior class level of 4th and an expert class level of 3rd.
