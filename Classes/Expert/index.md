### Martial Feats
Martial adventurers earn their gold with pure physical prowess. They swing across chapels on chandelier chains, bash through iron-banded oaken doors, and leap over chasms in pursuit of their foes. When locked in mortal melee, their martial feats turn the course of battle: a brazen bull rush to push back the enemy lines, a swinging flail to entangle the beastman’s sword arm, or a well-placed dagger through the enemy knight’s visor.

Prior to any attack roll, a martial feat, or feat for short, can be declared. This feat is a dramatic combat maneuver within the scope of the current combat. For example, a character may try to disarm an enemy with his next attack, or trip the opponent, or smash him backward to open access to a nearby corridor. The feat does not increase damage but could have some other combat effect: pushing back an enemy, tripping or entangling it, temporarily blinding it, and so on.

The feat die determines the feat's success. This is a d4 and can be enlarged by taking talents from the martial feat talent tree. If the feat die meets a DC (typically 3, but higher at GM discretion) and the attack hits, then the feat succeeds. If the feat die is not equal to or higher than the DC, or the overall attack misses, then the feat fails as well.
