# Bard Talent Tree
Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to discover them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.

## Core Talents

### Bardic Inspiration
You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d20.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die as an instance of advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or defence check it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the original die before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalise your wounded allies during a short rest. At the end of the short rest, you and any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain stamina equal to the result of one Hit Die plus their Constitution modifier.

### Jack of All Trades
You may reroll any ability check that you make that does not benefit from proficiency, but you must take the result.

### Countercharm
