# Rogue Talent Tree

## Sneak Attack
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The source of the advantage must be environmental (proficiency does not count). The attack may not use a weapon with the slow property.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it and that enemy isn't incapacitated.

The amount of extra damage dice increases by 1 die for every 2 talents that you have in this tree.

Additionally, you can forego your Sneak Attack damage to force your target to roll on the [injury table](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/Injuries/) instead of taking stamina damage.

## Bad Feeling
You have a wary eye, bordering on paranoia. When you roll for initiative, you can move up to your speed. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.

Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Steady Aim
As a bonus action you can give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
