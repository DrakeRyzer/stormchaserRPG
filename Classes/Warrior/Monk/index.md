# Monk Talent Tree
For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield. It is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. These warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be.

## Core Talents

### Martial Arts
Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are short swords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or unwieldy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armour or wielding a shield:
* You learn the brawling fighting style. If you already know the brawling fighting style, gain 4 character points.
* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.
* You treat monk weapons as unarmed strikes. If the weapon's damage die is smaller than your unarmed strike damage die, use your unarmed strike damage die.

### Dance of the Crane
While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your speed increases by 10 feet and you may use your Wisdom defence in place of your Strength or Dexterity defence versus melee and ranged attacks.

Additionally, the first time each round that you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, you can deflect or catch the missile as a free action. When you do so, the damage that you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.

### Chi
*Prerequisite:* Martial Arts and Dance of the Crane<br>
Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of chi. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of chi points equal to your Wisdom modifier.

You can spend these points to fuel various chi features. You start knowing four such features: Deflect Missiles, Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind.

When you spend a chi point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended chi back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your chi points.

Some of your chi features require you to make a chi attack roll versus your target's defence. This is an attack roll using your unarmed proficiency and your Wisdom bonus.

#### Dedicated Weapon
Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your chi on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:
* The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.
* You must be proficient with it.
* It must lack the unwieldy and special properties.

#### Deflect Missiles
If you catch a missile that was shot at you, you can spend 1 chi point to make a ranged attack as a free action with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

#### Flurry of Blows
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

#### Patient Defense
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

#### Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.
