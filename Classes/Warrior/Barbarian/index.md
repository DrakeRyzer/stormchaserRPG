# Barbarian Talent Tree

## Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. You have a number of rage points equal to your Constitution score. You can spend these points to fuel various rage powers. When you spend a rage point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you recover all of your expended rage back.

On your turn, you can spend a rage point to enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armour:
* You have advantage on Strength checks.
* When you make a melee weapon attack, you deal an additional 1d4 damage. This bonus damage die increases to a d6 at 5 barbarian talents, a d8 at 9 barbarian talents, a d10 at 13 barbarian talents and a d12 at 17 barbarian talents.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you canâ€™t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or been hit by an attack since then. You can also end your rage at any time (no action required).

As a barbarian gains talents, they learn to use their rage in new ways. When you take your second barbarian talent, you also gain a rage power. You gain another rage power for every two barbarian talents of barbarian taken after the 2nd. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.

Any barbarian who meets the powers' prerequisites can select and use rage powers. Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers; for example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with "dragon totem" in its title).

## Natural Resilience
You have innate Damage Reduction equal to your Constitution modifier. This DR does not stack with armour, but when wearing armour you may use the better of your Constitution modifier or the armour's DR.

## Reckless Attack
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
