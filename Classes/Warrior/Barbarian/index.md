# Barbarian Talent Tree
For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques. They are not soldiers or professional warriors, they are the battle-possessed. Creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilised and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.

**As long as at least half of your warrior talents are from the barbarian talent tree, your stamina increases to 5× your Constitution score.**

## Core Talents

### Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. You have a number of rage points equal to your Constitution score. You can spend these points to fuel various rage powers. When you spend a rage point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you recover all of your expended rage back.

On your turn, you can spend a rage point to enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armour:
* You have advantage on Strength checks.
* When you make a melee weapon attack, you deal an additional 1d4 damage. This bonus damage die increases to a d6 at 5 barbarian talents, a d8 at 9 barbarian talents, a d10 at 13 barbarian talents and a d12 at 17 barbarian talents.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or been hit by an attack since then. You can also end your rage at any time (no action required).

As a barbarian gains talents, they learn to use their rage in new ways. When you take your 3rd barbarian talent, you also gain a rage power. You gain another rage power for every two barbarian talents of barbarian taken after the 3rd. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.

Any barbarian who meets the powers' prerequisites can select and use rage powers. Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers; for example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with "dragon totem" in its title).

### Natural Resilience
You have innate Damage Reduction equal to your Constitution modifier. This DR does not stack with armour, but when wearing armour you may use the better of your Constitution modifier or the armour's DR.

Additionally, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. Attack rolls for effects that you can see, such as traps and spells, that target your Dexterity defence have disadvantage. You also have advantage on Dexterity defence checks against such effects. To gain this benefit, you can’t be [blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/), [deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/), or [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/).

### Reckless Attack
*Prerequisite:* Rage<br>
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Extra Attack
*Prerequisite:* 3 Other Warrior Talents<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the [Attack](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/ActionsinCombat/Attack/#attack-) action on your turn.

### Fast Movement
*Prerequisite:* Reckless Attack<br>
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armour.

### Instinctive Pounce
*Prerequisite:* Fast Movement<br>
As part of the bonus action that you take to enter your rage, you can move up to half your speed.

### Feral Instinct
*Prerequisite:* Natural Resilience<br>
Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/), you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Brutal Critical
*Prerequisite:* Instinctive Pounce<br>
You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

YOu may take this talent up to three times.

### Relentless Rage
*Prerequisite:* Brutal Critical and Feral Instinct<br>
Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution defence check at the start of your next turn. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this talent after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Persistent Rage
*Prerequisite:* Brutal Critical II and Relentless Rage<br>
Your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

### Indomitable Might
*Prerequisite:* Brutal Critical III and Persistent Rage<br>
If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion
*Prerequisite:* Brutal Critical III and Indomitable Might<br>
You embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

## Ancestral Guardian Talents
Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.

Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

### Ancestral Protectors
Spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you’re raging, the first creature that you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn’t against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.

### Spirit Shield
*Prerequisite:* Ancestral Protectors<br>
The guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. Once per round, if you are raging and an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can reduce that damage by 2d6 as a free action.

This increases to 3d6 when you take your 3rd Ancestral Guardian talent and to 4d6 when you take your 4th Ancestral Guardian talent.

### Consult the Spirits
*Prerequisite:* Ancestral Protectors<br>
You gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the augury or clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

After you cast either spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Vengeful Ancestors
*Prerequisite:* Spirit Shield<br>
Your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.
