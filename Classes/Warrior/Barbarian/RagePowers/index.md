## Blood For Blood
No one strikes you without reprisal in kind. When an enemy strikes you in melee, you can use your Reaction to spend 2 Rage Points and make an attack roll against the triggering target. This attack targets the Defense stat used to make the triggering attack. On a hit, you deal damage equal to your CON modifier plus Rage damage bonus.

## Scatter the Hordes
While you are grappling a target of equal or smaller size, you can spend 3 Rage Points to throw them. As an Action, make a Rage Attack roll against a target's STR Defense. On a success, you throw them in any direction you choose, a distance equal to 5 times your STR modifier. If the target hits something before the end of this distance, they take 1d4 damage for every 5' of distance remaining. At the end of this movement, the target falls prone.

## Seize the Prey
When you grapple a target while Raging, you can spend a Bonus actionto begin strangling them with a free hand. A target larger than you requires two hands to do this. Each round you grapple the target in this way, you can spend 1 Rage point to automatically deal damage equal to your unarmed strike.

When you hit a target, you can spend 4 Rage Points to push the target 10' away and knock them unconscious until the beginning of your next turn. If you critically hit the target when triggering this Power, they are then Dazed after the regain consciousness.

## Reaping
You can spend up to half of your current Rage Points when you hit a target to gain temporary hit points. When you do, the amount gained equals the Rage Points spent, multiplied by the number of times this Power has been taken. This power can be taken up to 3 times.

## Primal Terror

On a success, targets within 10' are Frightened, and all targets within 30' suffer disadvantage on attacks that target you. This effect lasts for 1 minute. Targets can save against your Rage Power DC to end the effect.
