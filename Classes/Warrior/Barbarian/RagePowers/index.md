# Rage Powers

## Blood For Blood
No one strikes you without reprisal in kind. At the start of your turn, if you were hit in melee in the last round, you can spend 2 rage points to make a melee or thrown weapon attack against as a bonus action.

## Fury Manifested
When you hit a target with a melee or thrown weapon attack, you can spend 4 rage points to push the target 10' away from you leave them [dazed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Dazed/) until the beginning of your next turn. If you critically hit the target when triggering this rage power, then they are [stunned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Stunned/) until the beginning of your next turn.

## Reaping
When you hit a target you can expend rage points to gain temporary stamina. When you do so, the amount of temporary stamina gained is equal to the number of rage points spent, multiplied by 5.

## Seize the Prey
When you grapple a target while raging, if you have a free hand, then you can spend 1 rage point strangle the target in place of an unarmed attack. On a hit, you deal no damage, but begin strangling the target. A target one size larger than you requires two hands to do this. A target two sizes larger than you cannot be strangled in this way. Each round, you must spend an attack to maintain the strangle hold. As long as you do so, the target is [suffocating](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/Suffocating/).

## Scatter the Hordes
While you are grappling a target of equal or smaller size, you can spend 3 Rage Points to throw them. As an action, make an unarmed attack roll. On a hit, you throw them a distance equal to 5 times your Strength modifier in any direction that you choose. If the target hits something before the end of this distance, roll your rage damage die once for every 5 feet of distance remaining. The target takes this much damage. At the end of this movement, the target falls prone.
