# Rage Powers

## Blood For Blood
No one strikes you without reprisal in kind. At the start of your turn, if you were hit in melee in the last round, you can spend 2 rage points to make a melee or thrown weapon attack against as a bonus action.

## Fury Manifested
When you hit a target with a melee or thrown weapon attack, you can spend 4 rage points to push the target 10' away from you leave them [dazed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Dazed/) until the beginning of your next turn. If you critically hit the target when triggering this rage power, then they are [stunned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Stunned/) until the beginning of your next turn.

## Reaping
When you hit a target you can expend rage points to gain temporary stamina. When you do so, the amount of temporary stamina gained is equal to the number of rage points spent, multiplied by 5.

## Scatter the Hordes
While you are grappling a target of equal or smaller size, you can spend 3 Rage Points to throw them. As an action, make an unarmed attack roll. On a hit, you throw them a distance equal to 5 times your Strength modifier in any direction that you choose. If the target hits something before the end of this distance, roll your rage damage die once for every 5 feet of distance remaining. The target takes this much damage. At the end of this movement, the target falls prone.

## Seize the Prey
When you grapple a target while raging, if you have a free hand, then you can spend 1 rage point strangle the target in place of an unarmed attack. On a hit, you deal no damage, but begin strangling the target. A target one size larger than you requires two hands to do this. A target two sizes larger than you cannot be strangled in this way. Each round, you must spend an attack to maintain the strangle hold. As long as you do so, the target is [suffocating](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/Suffocating/).

## Armor Crush
You can spend 2 Rage Point after a successful attack to make the target Vulnerable to your weapon damage type. This effect lasts until the target passes a successful CON check. 

## Bone Breaker
You can spend 2 Rage Point after a successful attack to impose the Weakened condition on a target. This effect lasts until the target passes a successful CON check.

## Barreling Charge
If you take the Charge Action, and your attack hits, you can spend 2 Rage Points to inflict Dazed on the target until the beginning of your next turn.

## Great Throw
When you throw a ranged weapon, you can put the full force of your Rage behind it. By spending up to 3 Rage Points, you can add an additional weapon damage die for each point spent in this way. If you spend at least 2 Rage Points in this way, the target is also knocked prone. Your maximum range also increases by 5 times your STR modifier, and your Long range threshold replaces your Short range.

## Knockdown
You spend 2 Rage Points when you make a successful melee or ranged attack to knock the target prone and inflict the Dazed condition until the end of their next turn.

## Rip and Tear
When you make a successful melee attack, you can spend 3 Rage Points inflict a Bleed effect on the target that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your STR modifier.

## Whirlwind
Your Rage drives you across the battlefield on a vicious, reaping path. You can spend 1 Rage point to attack a target, then move to attack another target. The second target must be close enough to reach in melee with your remaining move distance. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. These attacks do not use your STR modifier and only half of your Rage dice (rounded up) are rolled. You can repeat this effect for 1 Rage Point as long as you have enough Move speed remaining during your turn.

## Death Dealer
(Declare prior to attack, plus number of Rage Points being spent. Inflict extra Rage damage based on Points spent as Necrotic damage, cannot be reduced)

## Focus of the Aesthetic
YOu can spend 1 Rage Point as a bonus action or as part of the bonus action to activate your Rage to gain blindsight (30') for the remainder of your Rage. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sound, as long as you aren't Deafened.

## Leap to the Fray!
You can spend 3 Rage points as part of your Move to leap into the air. The distance can be up to your maximum Move distance for the turn, and the height is equal to 5 times your STR Modifier. If you attack at the end of this movement, you can convert any damage you would take from falling as additional damage on your attack.
