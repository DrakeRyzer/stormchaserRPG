# Wizard Talent Tree
Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible. Such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, revelling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.

## Spellcasting
When you take your first wizard talent, your spellcasting class feature for the mage class is affected in the following ways.

### Spellcasting Ability
Choose Intelligence or Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for your mage spells. You learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use use your chosen ability whenever a mage spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use the modifier of your chosen ability when making an attack roll with a mage spell that you cast.

### Spellbook
You have a spellbook containing three cantrips and six 1st-level of your choice from the wizard spell list. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know.

## Core Talents

### Arcane Recovery
*Prerequisite:* 1 Other Wizard Talent<br>
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you may choose expended spell points to recover. These spell points may have a combined value that is equal to or less than the highest level of spells that you can cast.

For example, if you can cast second level spells, you can recover up to two spell points.

### Spell Mastery
*Prerequisite:* 9th Level Spells and 5 Other Wizard Talents<br>
You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level mage spell and a 2nd-level mage spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

### Signature Spells
*Prerequisite:* 10th Level Spells and 6 Other Wizard Talents<br>
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level mage spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

### Archmage
*Prerequisite:* 10th Level Spells and 6 Other Wizard Talents<br>
You have mastered the arcane arts. Your spellcasting ability score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score also increases by 4.
