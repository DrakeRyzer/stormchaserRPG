# Mage

### Spellcasting
See [Spells Rules](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spellcasting/) for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the arcane spell list.

#### Cantrips
You know a number of cantrips of your choice from the arcane spell list equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. If your spellcasting ability modifier increases, then you learn additional arcane cantrips of your choice.

#### Mana
You have 3 mana with which to cast your arcane spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these arcane spells, you must expend an amount of mana equal to the spellâ€™s level. You regain all expended mana when you finish a long rest.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (see [Adventuring Gear](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/AdventuringGear/)) as a spellcasting focus for your arcane spells.

## Talents
Disciples may take talents from the [sorcerer](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Sorcerer/), [warlock](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Warlock/), [wizard](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Wizard/) and [spellcasting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Spellcasting/) talent trees.
