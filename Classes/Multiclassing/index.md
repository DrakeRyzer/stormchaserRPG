# Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to take talents from other classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realise a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of spending character points on a talent from a new class, instead of taking a talent from your current class. As you advance, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few talents from another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in all three classes. Compared to a single-class character with the same number of talents, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

## Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a warrior who decides to multiclass into the mage class must have both Strength (or Dexterity) and one mental score of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

##### Multiclassing Prerequisites

| Class | Ability Score Minimum |
|:-----:|:---------------------:|
| Expert | Dexterity 13, Intelligence 13, Wisdom 13 or Charisma 13 |
| Mage | Spellcasting Ability 13 |
| Priest | Spellcasting Ability 13 |
| Warrior |  Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |

## Stamina Multiplier and Stamina Dice
Use the stamina multiplier of the class from which you have the most talents.

Add together the Stamina Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Stamina Dice. If the Stamina Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. If your classes give you Stamina Dice of different types, keep track of them separately.

## Proficiencies
When you gain your first talent in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

###### Multiclassing Proficiencies

| Class | Proficiencies gained |
|:-----:|:---------------------:|
| Expert | Light armour, 3 character points |
