# Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to take talents from other classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realise a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of spending character points on a talent from a new class, instead of taking a talent from your current class. As you advance, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few talents from another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in all three classes. Compared to a single-class character with the same number of talents, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

## Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a warrior who decides to multiclass into the mage class must have both Strength (or Dexterity) and one mental score of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

##### Multiclassing Prerequisites

| Class | Ability Score Minimum |
|:-----:|:---------------------:|
| Disciple | Spellcasting Ability 13 |
| Expert | Dexterity 13, Intelligence 13, Wisdom 13 or Charisma 13 |
| Mage | Spellcasting Ability 13 |
| Warrior |  Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |

## Stamina Multiplier and Recovery Dice
Use the stamina multiplier and recovery dice of the class from which you have the most talents.

## Proficiencies
When you gain your first talent in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

###### Multiclassing Proficiencies

| Class | Proficiencies Gained |
|:-----:|:--------------------:|
| Disciple | Increase your armour proficiency by 1 weight category to a maximum of medium |
| Expert | Light armour, 3 character points |
| Mage | - |
| Warrior | Increase your armour proficiency by 1 weight category, 1 martial weapon group |

You don't receive the class's starting equipment.

## Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

### Spells Known and Prepared
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. For example, if you are a mage with a spellcasting attribute of 18 and multiclass as a disciple with a spellcasting ability of 18, then you know 4 arcane cantrips and 2 arcane spells per spell level that you can cast. As a disciple, you know 3 divine cantrips and can prepare 3 disciple spells of each spell level.

Each spell that you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes. You use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

If a cantrip of yours increases in power after a certain number of talents have been learned, the increase is based on your talents from classes that can learn that cantrip.

### Mana
You determine your available mana based on your highest level [spellcasting talent](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Spellcasting/).
