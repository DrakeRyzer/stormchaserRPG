### Spellcasting
See [Spells Rules](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spellcasting/) for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the divine spell list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Choose Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for your disciple spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion and attunement to a higher power. You use your chosen ability whenever a disciple spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use the modifier of your chosen ability when making an attack roll with a disciple spell that you cast.

#### Cantrips
You know a number of cantrips of your choice from the divine spell list equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. If your spellcasting ability modifier increases, then you learn additional divine cantrips of your choice.

#### Mana
You have 3 mana with which to cast your divine spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these divine spells, you must expend an amount of mana equal to the spell’s level. You regain all expended mana when you finish a long rest.

#### Preparing Spells
You prepare the list of disciple spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the divine spell list. When you do so, choose a number of disciple spells of each spell level that you can cast equal to your spellcasting ability modifer.

For example, if you are a disciple with 3 talents, you have 15 spell points. With a spellcasting ability of 16, your list of prepared spells can include 3 1st-level spells and 3 2nd-level spells. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it at 1st level or 2nd level. Casting the spell does not remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of disciple spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol or druidic focus (see [Adventuring Gear](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/AdventuringGear/)) as a spellcasting focus for your disciple spells.

### Potent Cantrips
*Prerequisite:* 5 Other Disciple or Mage Talents<br>
Your cantrips deal one additional die of damage.

## Talents
Disciples may take talents from the [cleric](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Cleric/), [druid](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Druid/), [paladin](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Paladin/) and [spellcasting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Spellcasting/) talent trees.
