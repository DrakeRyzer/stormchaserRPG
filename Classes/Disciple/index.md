### Spellcasting
See [Spells Rules](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spellcasting/) for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the disciple spell list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Choose Wisdom or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for your disciple spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion and attunement to a higher power. You use your chosen ability whenever a disciple spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your the modifier of your chosen ability when making an attack roll with a disciple spell that you cast.

#### Cantrips
You know a number of cantrips of your choice from the disciple spell list equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. If your spellcasting ability modifier increases, then you learn additional disciple cantrips of your choice.

#### Spell Points
The table below shows how many spell points you have to cast your disciple spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these disciple spells, you must expend a number of spell points equal to the spell’s level. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.

| Disciple Talents | Spell Points | Maximum Spell Level |
|:----------------:|:------------:|:-------------------:|
| 1 | 9 | 1st |
| 2 | 12 | 1st |
| 3 | 15 | 2nd |
| 4 | 18 | 2nd |
| 5 | 21 | 3rd |
| 6 | 24 | 3rd |
| 7 | 27 | 4th |
| 8 | 30 | 4th |
| 9 | 33 | 5th |
| 10 | 36 | 5th |

### Preparing Spells
You prepare the list of disciple spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the disciple spell list. When you do so, choose a number of disciple spells equal to your spellcasting ability score. The spells must be of a level that you can cast.

For example, if you are a disciple with 3 talents, you have 15 spell points. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include 16 spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it at 1st-level or 2nd-level. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of disciple spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol or druidic focus (see [Adventuring Gear](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/AdventuringGear/)) as a spellcasting focus for your disciple spells.

### Ritual Casting
You can cast a disciple spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
