# Tempest Domain
Gods whose portfolios include the Tempest domain govern storms, sea, and sky. They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods of earthquakes, some fire gods, and certain gods of violence, physical strength and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.

## Domain Features

### Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency with four martial weapon groups and heavy armour.

### Domain Spells
As a tempest cleric, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Destructive Wrath
*Prerequisite:* Channel Divinity<br>
You can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of the storm with unchecked ferocity.

When you roll lightning or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.

## Talents

### Wrath of the Storm
You can thunderously rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, it must make a Dexterity defence check vs your passive spellcasting attack score. If the creature fails the defence check, it takes 1d8 lightning damage and 1d8 thunder damage. If the creature succeeds at the defence check, it takes half as much damage.

You can rebuke a number of attacks equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum one). Wrath of the Storm always triggers automatically when you are hit, unless you declare on your turn that you will not use it in response to being hit by certain targets. Alternatively, you can also declare that you will only use Wrath of the Storm when hit by a specific target. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Thunderbolt Strike
*Prerequisite:* 3rd Level Spells and Wrath of the Storm<br>
When you deal lightning damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

### Stormborn
*Prerequisite:* 8th Level Spells and Thunderbolt Strike<br>
You have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed whenever you are not underground or indoors.
