# Cleric Talent Tree
In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater purpose. Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people. Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.

## Core Talents

### Channel Divinity
You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you gain additional cleric talents, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. Some Channel Divinity effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect from this talent tree, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

You can use your Channel Divinity a number of times equal to half your spellcasting ability modifier (round up). You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

| Spellcasting Ability Modifier | Channel Divinity Uses |
|:-----------------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Less than 3 | 1 |
| 3 or 4 | 2 |
| 5 | 3 |

You can also expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer and regain two expended spell points.

#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Make an attack roll against each undead within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you. On a hit, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take make opportunity attacks. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

### Destroy Undead
*Prerequisite:* Channel Divinity<br>
When an undead is hit by your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below half your number of cleric talents.

### Divine Intervention
*Prerequisite:* 5th Level Spells<br>
You can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your total number of cleric talents, then your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any disciple spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

If you have 20 or more cleric talents, your call for intervention succeeds automatically and no roll is required.

### Prophet
*Prerequisite:* 10th Level Spells and 8 Other Cleric Talents<br>
You are the perfect servant of your God. Your spellcasting ability score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score also increases by 4.

## Forge Domain
The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithril have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armour and powerful weapons to protect them.

###### Forge Domain Bonus Spells Prepared

| Spell Level | Spells |
|:-----------:|:------:|
| 1st | *Identify, Searing Smite* |
| 2nd | *Heat Metal, Magic Weapon* |
| 3rd | *Elemental Weapon, Protection from Energy* |
| 4th | *Fabricate, Wall of Fire* |
| 5th | *Animate Objects, Creation* |

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain, you gain proficiency with heavy armour and smith’s tools.

### Blessing of the Forge
You gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armour. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armour or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to DR if it’s armour or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing
*Prerequisite:* Channel Divinity<br>
You can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.

You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armour, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object (see Chapter 5: Equipment for examples of these items). The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.

The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.

The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

### Soul of the Forge
*Prerequisite:* Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing<br>
Your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:
* You gain resistance to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armour, you gain a +1 bonus to DR.

### Divine Strike
*Prerequisite:* Soul of the Forge<br>
You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the fiery power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. You can take this talent a second time to increase the bonus fire damage to 2d8.

### Saint of Forge and Fire
*Prerequisite:* Divine Strike<br>
Your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:
* You gain immunity to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armour, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

## Grave Domain
Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.

###### Grave Domain Bonus Spells Prepared

| Spell Level | Spells |
|:-----------:|:------:|
| 1st | *Bane, False Life* |
| 2nd | *Gentle Repose, Ray of Enfeeblement* |
| 3rd | *Revivify, Vampiric Touch* |
| 4th | *Blight, Death Ward* |
| 5th | *Antilife Shell, Raise Dead* |

### Circle of Mortality
You gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

You also learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which doesn't count towards the number of cleric cantrips that you know. For you, it can be cast as a bonus action, does not require verbal components to cast and has a range of 30-feet.

### Eyes of the Grave
You gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you anything about a creature’s capabilities or identity.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave
*Prerequisite:* Channel Divinity<br>
You can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature’s life force for termination.

As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack’s damage, and then the curse ends.

### Sentinel at Death’s Door
*Prerequisite:* Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave<br>
You gain the ability to impede death’s progress. Each round, the first time that you or a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, that hit is turned into into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Keeper of Souls
*Prerequisite:* Sentinel at Death's Door<br>
You can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When an enemy you can see dies within 60 feet of you, you or one creature of your choice that is within 60 feet of you regains hit points equal to the enemy's number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren't incapacitated. Once you use it, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.
