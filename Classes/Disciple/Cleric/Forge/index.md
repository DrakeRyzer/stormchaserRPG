# Forge Domain
The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithril have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armour and powerful weapons to protect them.

## Domain Features

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain, you gain proficiency with heavy armour and smith’s tools.

### Domain Spells
As a forge cleric, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the disciple spell list, that spell is nevertheless a disciple spell for you.

### Artisan's Blessing
*Prerequisite:* Channel Divinity<br>
You can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.

You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armour, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object (see Chapter 5: Equipment for examples of these items). The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.

The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.

The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

## Talents

### Blessing of the Forge
You gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armour. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armour or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to DR if it’s armour or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Soul of the Forge
*Prerequisite:* 3rd Level Spells and Blessing of the Forge<br>
Your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:
* You gain resistance to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armour, you gain a +1 bonus to DR.

### Saint of Forge and Fire
*Prerequisite:* 8th Level Spells and Soul of the Forge<br>
Your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:
* You gain immunity to fire damage.
* While wearing heavy armour, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
