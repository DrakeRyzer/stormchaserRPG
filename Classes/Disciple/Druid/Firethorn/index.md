# Circle of the Firethorn
Druids who are members of the Circle of Firethorns devote themselves to being a true force for nature, seeking to drive back those that encroach upon, lack respect or exploit nature. These druids are not afraid to make their presence known at the front of this battle. Their ability to call upon nature and transform their body into a weapon makes them well suited for this calling. Once their foes are dispatched, they call upon the cleansing fires so that nature may reclaim its territory.

## Circle Features

### Circle Spells
You learn the *Thorn Whip* cantrip. If you already know that cantrip you may learn another cantrip of your choose from the disciple spell list. Additionally, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain a circle spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have a circle spell that doesn’t appear on the disciple spell list, that spell is nevertheless a disciple spell for you.

## Talents

### Thorn Growth
*Prerequisite:* Wild Shape<br> 
You gain the ability to produce thorny vines from your body, which can protect you from incoming blows as well as being used offensively. As a bonus action, you can cast Wild Shape to sprout these vines rather than transforming into a beast form. You gain 1d4 + 4 temporary stamina at lst level of Wild Shape and 5 additional temporary stamina for each level above 1st. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:
* You have advantage on strength ability checks. Creatures have disadvantage on attacks against your Strength defence, excluding melee and ranged attacks.
* You can use a bonus action to make one attack with your thorns against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the thorns deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. 
* When you grapple a creature, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage if you successfully grapple the target. 
* You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all the temporary stamina or you cast Wild Shape again.

### Extra Attack
*Prerequisite:* 3rd Level Spells and Thorn Growth<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Burning Thorns
*Prerequisite:* 5th level Spells and Extra Attack<br>
You gain the ability to quickly expel some of your thorns with a burst of fiery energy. As a free action on your turn, you can launch these burning thorns at a creature that attacked you within the previous round that is within 60 feet. Make a spell attack roll versus the creature’s Dexterity defence. It takes 1d10 piercing + 1d10 fire damage + your spellcasting ability modifier on a hit, or half as much on miss.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Scorching Spirit
*Prerequisite:* 7th level Spells and Burning Thorns<br>
The fiery spirit of nature grows within you and is just below the surface, ready to provide you protection. 
* You have immunity to fire damaage.
* Creatures that you grapple automatically take 1d8 fire damage if you maintain the grapple at the end of your turn. Additionally, creatures that grapple you automatically take 1d8 fire damage if they maintain the grapple at the end of their turn. 
* If you drop to 0 hit points and remain unconscious, on your next turn your spirit appears as a ***fire elemental*** in an unoccupied space next to your body. This form cannot regain lost hit points and you remain in this form until your body receives healing or you fail three death saving throws. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
