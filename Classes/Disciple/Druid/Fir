# Circle of the Firethorn
Druids who are members of the Circle of Firethorns devote themselves to being a true force for nature, seeking to drive back those that encroach upon, lack respect or exploit nature. These druids are not afraid to make their presence known at the front of this battle. Their ability to call upon nature and transform their body into a weapon makes them well suited for this calling. Once their foes are dispatched, they call upon the cleansing fires so that nature may reclaim its territory.
