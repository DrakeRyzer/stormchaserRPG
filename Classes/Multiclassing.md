# Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

## Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a warrior who decides to multiclass into the mage class must have both Strength (or Dexterity) and one mental score of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

##### Multiclassing Prerequisites

| Class | Ability Score Minimum |
|:-----:|:---------------------:|
| Expert | Dexterity 13, Intelligence 13, Wisdom 13 or Charisma 13 |
| Mage | Intelligence 13, Wisdom 13, or Charisma 13 |
| Warrior |  Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |

## Stamina and Hit Dice
You gain the stamina from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level stamina for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

## Proficiencies
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

##### Multiclassing Proficiencies

| Class | Proficiencies gained |
|:-----:|:---------------------:|
| Expert | Light armour, 3 character points |
| Mage | - |
| Warrior | Increase your armour proficiency by 1 weight category, 1 martial weapon group |

## Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. However, you don't receive the class's starting equipment and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity and Extra Attack.

### Channel Divinity
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

### Extra Attack
If more than one of your classes grants the Extra Attack class feature at level five, you gain this class feature when the sum of your levels in those classes is five or greater.
