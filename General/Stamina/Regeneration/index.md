# Fast Healing and Regeneration
A creature with fast healing or regeneration regains the listed amount of Stamina each round at the beginning of its turn. A creature with regeneration has additional benefits. Its dying condition canâ€™t increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3) as long as its regeneration is active. If it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn, including against the triggering damage.
