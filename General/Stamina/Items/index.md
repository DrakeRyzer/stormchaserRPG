# Items and Stamina
Just as creatures have Stamina, items have an equivalent resource known as **Integrity**. An item has a Damage Reduction (DR) statistic that reduces the damage that the item takes by that amount. The item then takes any damage left over. If an item is reduced to 0 Integrity, then it is destroyed. An item also has a [Broken](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Broken/) threshold (typically half of its Integrity). If its Integrity is reduced to this amount or lower, then it is broken, meaning that it cannot be used for its normal function and it doesn’t grant bonuses. You usually can’t attack an attended object (one on a creature’s person).
