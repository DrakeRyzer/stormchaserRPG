# Healing
Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. [Rest](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/Resting/) can restore a creature's stamina and magic such as a *cure wounds* spell or a *potion of healing* removes damage instantly.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, the stamina regained is added to its current stamina. A creature's stamina can't exceed its stamina maximum, so any stamina regained in excess of this number is lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 stamina of healing. If the ranger has 50 current stamina and has a stamina maximum of 56, the ranger regains 6 stamina from the druid, not 8.

A creature that has died can't regain stamina until magic such as the *revivify* spell has restored it to life.
