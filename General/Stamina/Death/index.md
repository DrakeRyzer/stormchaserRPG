# Death
After you die, you can’t act or regain actions, can’t be affected by spells that target creatures (unless they specifically target dead creatures) and for all other purposes you are an object. When you die, you are reduced to 0 Stamina if you had a different
amount and you can’t be brought above 0 Stamina for as long as you remain dead. Some magic can bring creatures back to life, such as the [Resurrect]() ritual or the [Raise Dead]() spell.
