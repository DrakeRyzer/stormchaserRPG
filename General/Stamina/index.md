# Stamina, Healing and Dying
All creatures and objects have Stamina. Your maximum Stamina value represents your health, wherewithal and heroic drive. It is a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live and luck.

When you take damage, you reduce your current Stamina by a number equal to the damage dealt. The loss of stamina has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 stamina. A creature's current stamina (usually just called stamina) can be any number from the creature's stamina maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Some spells, items and other effects, as well as simply [resting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/Resting/), can heal living or undead creatures. When you are healed, you regain Stamina equal to the amount healed, up to your maximum Stamina.

Creatures with more stamina are more difficult to kill. Those with less stamina are more fragile.
