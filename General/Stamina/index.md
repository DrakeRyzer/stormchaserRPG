# Stamina, Healing and Dying
All creatures and objects have Stamina. Your maximum Stamina value represents your health, wherewithal and heroic drive when you are in good health and rested. When you take damage, you reduce your current Stamina by a number equal to the damage dealt.

Some spells, items and other effects, as well as simply resting, can heal living or undead creatures. When you are healed, you regain Stamina equal to the amount healed, up to your maximum Stamina.
