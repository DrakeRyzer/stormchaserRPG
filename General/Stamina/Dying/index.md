# Knocked Out and Dying
Creatures cannot be reduced to less than 0 Stamina. When a creature reaches 0 Stamina, it is knocked out and at risk of death (or, in the case of undead and construct creatures, destruction).

As a player character, when you are reduced to 0 Stamina, you’re knocked out with the following effects:
* You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 Stamina.
* You gain the dying 1 condition. If the effect that knocked you out was a critical success from the attacker or the result of your critical failure, you gain the dying 2 condition instead. If you have the [wounded]() condition, increase your dying value by an amount equal to your wounded value. If the damage was dealt by a nonlethal attack or nonlethal effect, you don’t gain the dying condition; you are instead unconscious with 0 Stamina.

## Taking Damage while Dying
If you take damage while you already have the dying condition, increase your dying condition value by 1, or by 2 if the damage came from an attacker’s critical hit or your own critical failure. If you have the wounded condition, remember to also add the value of your wounded condition to your dying value.

If you have the dying condition and you take damage that equals or exceeds your Stamina maximum, then you suffer instant death.
