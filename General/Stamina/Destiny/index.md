# Destiny and Dying
Sometimes, fate has other plans for a hero and you can spend [Destiny Points]() to achieve an outcome other than death.

## Destined Recovery
At the start of your turn or when your dying value would increase, if your party has at least 1 [Destiny Point](), then you can spend all of the party's remaining [Destiny Points]() to make a destined recovery. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilise with 1 Stamina. You don’t gain the wounded condition, or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way. However, if you already had that condition, then you don’t lose it or decrease its value.

## Destined Sacrifice
At the start of your turn or when your dying value would increase, if your foe has reason to take you prisoner and your party has at least 1 [Destiny Point](), then you can spend 1 [Destiny Point]() to surrender yourself or something else of value to the enemy. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilise with 0 Stamina. You don’t gain the wounded condition, or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way. However, if you already had that condition, then you don’t lose it or decrease its value.

While you are unconscious, one of the following happens:
* Your character is captured or separated from the party.
* A magic item, loved one, or some other thing of value is taken from the character.
* The enemy makes a decisive move (this can mean acting out of turn).
* The party loses the faith of an important group or ally.

The GM is the final arbiter of this decision.
