# Exertion
Sometimes, stamina can be deliberately spent to put extra effort into a specific action. When a player wishes to do this, they roll a recovery die, apply this number as a modifier to an associated roll and take the same amount of damage, which cannot be reduced in any way. Although this is generally a matter for GM fiat, here are some examples and suggested cases:
* Adding to the attack roll of a weapon attack.
* Adding to the damage of an attack or spell.
* Adding to the effect of a healing spell.
* Adding a number of five foot squares to a move.

Spellcasting is a special case. When rolling a recovery die to boost the attack roll of a spell, the player must multiply the damage they take by the spell's level (1 for cantrips).
