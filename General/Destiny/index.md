# Destiny Points
Your heroic deeds earn you Destiny Points, which grant you good fortune, or let you recover from the brink of death.

## Earning Destiny Points
The GM is in charge of awarding Destiny Points. Usually, the party gets 1 Destiny Point when a player plays out their character’s personality traits, gives in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, or otherwise portrays their character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in their game. Examples include:
* Great roleplaying moments. Deep storytelling with dramatic effect. Rich detail in describing combat.
* Working together as a team to overcome extraordinary odds. Defeating difficult opponents. Progressing the story when it is not openly directed by the GM.
* Creating a dramatic moment important to their character, or contributing to an important scene involving other player characters that advances their development.
* Performing heroic deeds. Something selfless, daring, or beyond normal expectations.

Additionally, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game, by nominating them for a Destiny Point. When another player does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, consider nominating that player for a Destiny Point.

You can have a maximum number of Destiny Points at a time equal to the number of characters in the party.

## Spending Destiny Points
You can spend your Destiny Points in several ways. None of these is an action and you can spend Destiny Points even if you aren’t able to act. You can spend a Destiny Point on behalf of your familiar or animal companion.

Any player in the party can spend a Destiny Point at any time to:
* Automatically treat a single d20 roll as a natural 20.
* Automatically cause an attack made against you to miss (even after the attack is resolved).
* Act out of turn (thus changing your position in the Initiative Order) once per encounter.
* Take damage that would otherwise harm another character within your reach.
* Have the party choose one of the possible results from a random effect table, instead of the GM rolling.

Alternatively, you can spend all of your party's Destiny Points (minimum 1) to avoid death. You can do this when your dying condition would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilise with 1 Stamina. You don’t gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way. However, if you already had that condition, then you don’t lose it or decrease its value.
