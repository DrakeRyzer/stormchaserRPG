# Step 4: If Damage Remains, Reduce the Target’s Stamina
After applying the target’s immunities, resistances and vulnerabilities to the damage, the damage reduces the target’s Stamina on a 1-to-1 basis. More information about Stamina can be found in [Stamina, Healing and Dying](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Stamina/).

## Non-Lethal Attacks
You can make a nonlethal attack in an effort to knock someone out instead of killing them (see [Knocked Out]() and [Dying]()). Weapons with the nonlethal trait (including fists) do this automatically. You take a -1d circumstance penalty to the attack roll when you make a non-lethal attack using a weapon that doesn’t have the non-lethal trait. You also take this penalty when making a lethal attack using a nonlethal weapon.

Spells and other effects with the non-lethal trait that reduce a creature to 0 Stamina knock the creature out instead of killing them.

## Massive Damage
When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its stamina maximum, the attacker makes an additional attack roll with a bonus of +5 vs the creature's Constitution defence. On a hit, the creature suffers a random effect determined by a roll on the table below. For example, the Constitution defence of a creature that has a stamina maximum of 30 is attacked if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

| 1d10 | Effect |
|:----:|:-------|
| 1 | The creature drops to 0 stamina. |
| 2-3 | The creature drops to 0 stamina but is stable. |
| 4-5 | The creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. |
| 6-7 | The creature cannot make opportunity attacks and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8-10 | The creature cannot make opportunity attacks until the end of its next turn. |

## Describing The Effects Of Damage 
Game Masters describe stamina loss in different ways. When your current stamina total is half or more of your stamina maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your stamina maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 stamina strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury, or knocking you unconscious.
