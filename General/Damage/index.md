# Damage
In the midst of combat, you attempt checks to determine if you can damage your foe with weapons, spells, or alchemical concoctions. On a successful check, you hit and deal damage. Damage decreases a creature’s Stamina on a 1-to-1 basis (so a creature that takes 6 damage loses 6 Stamina). The full rules can be found under [Hit Points, Healing and Dying]().

Damage is sometimes given as a fixed amount, but, more often than not, you’ll make a damage roll to determine how much damage you deal. A damage roll typically uses a number and type of dice determined by the weapon used or the spell cast and it is often enhanced by various modifiers, bonuses and penalties. Like checks, a damage roll (especially a melee weapon damage roll) is often modified by a number of modifiers, penalties and bonuses. When making a damage roll, you take the following steps, explained in detail below.
1. Roll the dice indicated by the weapon, unarmed attack, or spell and apply the modifiers, bonuses and penalties that apply to the result of the roll.
2. Determine the damage type.
3. Apply the target’s immunities, vulnerabilities and resistances to the damage.
4. If any damage remains, reduce the target’s Stamina by that amount.
