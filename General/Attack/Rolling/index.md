# Attack Rolls

### Proficiency
You also roll with +1d when you attack using a weapon or spell with which you have proficiency.
* A creature that is trained with its weapon adds a single d20 to its dice pool, for a total of 2d20.
* A creature that is an expert with its weapon adds 2d20 to its dice pool, for a total of 3d20.
* A creature that is a master with its weapon adds 3d20 to its dice pool, for a total of 4d20.

### Positioning
When you attack a creature in melee from higher ground, you have +1d to hit.

When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on foot, you get the same +1d on melee attacks for being on higher ground.

When you [flank](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/MovementandPosition/PlayingonaGrid/#flanking) a creature in melee, you also have +1d to hit.

## Rolling 1 or 20
Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's defence. In addition, the attack is a [critical hit](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/DamageRolls/#critical-hits). If you have a dice pool greater than 1 and multiple 20s are rolled, then the more 20s that you roll, the more powerful your critical hit.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's defence.
