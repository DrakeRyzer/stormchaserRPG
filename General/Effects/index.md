# Effects
Anything that you do in the game has an effect. Many of these outcomes are easy to adjudicate during the game. If you tell the GM that you draw your sword, no check is needed, and the result is that your character is now holding a sword. Other times, the specific effect requires more detailed rules governing how your choice is resolved. Many spells, magic items and talents create specific effects and your character will be subject to effects caused by monsters, hazards, the environment and other characters.

While a check might determine the overall impact or strength of an effect, a check is not always part of creating an effect. Casting a [Fly]() spell on yourself creates an effect that allows you to soar through the air, but casting the spell does not require a check. Conversely, using the [Intimidate]() skill to [Demoralise]() a foe does require a check and your result on that check determines the effectâ€™s outcome.

The following general rules are used to understand and apply effects.
