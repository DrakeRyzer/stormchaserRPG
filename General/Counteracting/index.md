# Counteracting
Some effects try to counteract spells, afflictions, conditions, or other effects. Counteract checks compare the power of two forces and determine which defeats the other. Successfully counteracting an effect ends it unless noted otherwise.

When attempting a counteract check, add the relevant attribute modifier or other appropriate modifier to your check against the target’s DC. If you’re counteracting an affliction, then the DC is in the affliction’s stat block. If it’s a spell, use the caster’s spell skill. For spells, the counteract check modifier is your spellcasting attribute modifier, plus any bonuses and penalties that specifically apply to counteract checks. What you can counteract depends on the check result and the target’s level. If an effect is a spell, its level is the counteract level.

**Critical Success:** Counteract the target if its counteract level is no more than 3 levels higher than your effect’s counteract level.

**Success:** Counteract the target if its counteract level is no more than 1 level higher than your effect’s counteract level.

**Failure:** Counteract the target if its counteract level is lower than your effect’s counteract level.

**Critical Failure:** You fail to counteract the target.
