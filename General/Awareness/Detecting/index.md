# Detecting Creatures
There are three conditions that measure the degree to which you can sense a creature: observed, hidden, and undetected. However, the concealed and invisible conditions can partially mask a creature, and the unnoticed condition indicates you have no idea a creature is around. In addition to the descriptions here, you can find these conditions under [Conditions](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/).

With the exception of invisible, these conditions are relative to the viewer. It’s possible for a creature to be observed to you but hidden from your ally. When you’re trying to target a creature that’s hard to see or otherwise sense, various drawbacks apply. Most of these rules apply to objects you’re trying to detect as well as creatures.

Typically, the GM tracks how well creatures detect each other, since neither party has perfect information. For example, you might think a creature is in the last place you sensed it, but it was able to Sneak away. Or you might think a creature can’t see you in the dark, but it has darkvision.

You can attempt to avoid detection by using [the Stealth skill](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Stealth/) to Avoid Notice, Hide, or Sneak, or by using [Deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) to Create a Diversion.

## Observed
In most circumstances, you can sense creatures without difficulty and target them normally. Creatures in this state are observed. Observing requires a precise sense, which for most creatures means sight, but see below for advice regarding creatures that don’t use sight as their primary sense. If you can’t observe the creature, it’s either hidden, undetected, or unnoticed, and you’ll need to factor in the targeting restrictions. Even if a creature is observed, it might still be concealed.

> ### Detecting With Other Senses
> Most abilities that designate "a creature that you can see" or the like function just as well if the user can precisely sense the subject with a different sense. If a monster uses a sense other than vision, the GM can adapt ways of avoiding detection that work with the monster’s senses. For example, a creature that has echolocation might use hearing as a primary sense. This could mean its quarry is
concealed in a noisy chamber, hidden in a great enough din, or invisible under a silence spell.

> ### Using Stealth With Other Senses
> The Stealth skill is designed to use Hide for avoiding visual detection and Avoid Notice and Sneak to avoid being both seen and heard. For many special senses, a player can describe how they're avoiding detection by that special sense and use the most applicable Stealth action. For instance, a creature stepping lightly to avoid being detected via tremorsense would be using Sneak.
> 
> In some cases, rolling a Dexterity-based Stealth skill check to Sneak doesn’t make the most sense. For example, a PC trying to avoid being detected by a creature that senses heartbeats might meditate to slow their heart rate, using Wisdom instead of Dexterity for their Stealth check. When a creature could detect you using multiple different senses, use your lowest applicable ability modifier.

## Hidden
A creature that’s hidden is only barely perceptible. You know what space a hidden creature occupies, but little else. Perhaps the creature just moved behind cover and successfully used the Hide action. Your target might be in a deep fog bank or behind a waterfall, where you can see some movement but can’t determine an exact location. Maybe you’ve been blinded or the creature is under the effects of *invisibility*, but you used the Seek basic action to determine its general location based on hearing alone. Regardless of the specifics, you’re flat-footed to a hidden creature.

When targeting a hidden creature, before you roll to determine your effect, you must attempt a DC 11 flat check. If you fail, you don’t affect the creature, though the actions you used are still expended, as well as any mana, costs, and other resources. You remain flat-footed to the creature, whether you successfully target it or not.

## Undetected
If a creature is undetected, you don’t know what space it occupies, you’re flat-footed to it, and you can’t easily target it. Using the Seek basic action can help you find an undetected creature, usually making it hidden from you instead of undetected. If a creature is undetected, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re unaware of its presence. You might suspect an undetected creature is in the room with you, even though you’re unable to find its space. The unnoticed condition covers creatures you’re entirely unaware of.

Targeting an undetected creature is difficult. If you suspect there’s a creature around, you can pick a square and attempt an attack. This works like targeting a hidden creature, but the flat check and attack roll are both rolled in secret by the GM. The GM won’t tell you why you missed, whether it was due to failing the flat check, rolling an insufficient attack roll, or choosing the wrong square. The GM might allow you to try targeting an undetected creature with some spells or other abilities in a similar fashion. Undetected creatures are subject to area effects normally.

For instance, suppose an enemy elf wizard cast *invisibility* and then Sneaked away. You suspect that with the elf’s Speed of 30 feet, they probably moved 15 feet toward an open door. You move up and attack a space 15 feet from where the elf started and directly on the path to the door. The GM secretly rolls an attack roll and flat check, but they know that you were not quite correct. The elf was actually in the adjacent space! The GM tells you that you missed, so you decide to make your next attack on the adjacent space, just in case. This time, it’s the right space, and the GM’s secret attack roll and flat check both succeed, so you hit!

## Unnoticed
If you have no idea a creature is even present, that creature is unnoticed by you. A creature that is undetected might also be unnoticed. This condition usually matters for abilities that can be used only against targets totally unaware of your presence.

When you are attacked by a creature that is unnoticed, you cannot use your stamina to avoid [injury](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/Injuries/). If you are hit by a damaging attack, then you must roll on the [injury](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/Injuries/) table. If the attacker rolls a natural 20, then you are knocked [unconscious](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Unconscious/) and must begin making death saves as though at 0 stamina.
