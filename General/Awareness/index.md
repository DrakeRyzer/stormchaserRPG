# Awareness
Your awareness measures your ability to notice things and tell whether something about a situation is suspicious. This statistic is frequently used for rolling initiative to determine who goes first in an encounter.

An awareness check takes your wisdom as its modifier. Awarness is not a skill, but your dice pool can be boosted by your species (e.g. an [elf's keen senses](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Species/Common/Elf/#keen-senses)), background (e.g. [outlander](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Origins/Backgrounds/Outlander/)) and the [acute senses talent](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Awareness/#acute-senses).

Outside of initiative, awareness is most often used passively. Your passive awareness score is calculated as follows: **10 + your wisdom modifier + dice pool modifiers**

The rules below describe the effects of light and visibility on your specific senses to perceive the world, as well as the rules for sensing and locating creatures with awareness.
