# Light
The amount of light in an area can affect how well you see things. There are three levels of light: bright light, dim light, and darkness. The rules in this book assume that all creatures are in bright light unless otherwise noted. A source of light lists the radius in which it sheds bright light, and it sheds dim light to double that radius.

## Bright Light
In bright light, such as sunlight, creatures and objects can be observed clearly by anyone with average vision or better. Some types of creatures are dazzled or blinded by bright light.

## Dim Light
Areas in shadow or lit by weak light sources are in dim light. Creatures and objects in dim light have the concealed condition, unless the seeker has darkvision or low-light vision (see [Special Senses](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Light/)), or a precise sense other than vision.

## Darkness
A creature or object within darkness is hidden or undetected unless the seeker has darkvision or a precise sense other than vision (see [Special Senses](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Light/)). A creature without darkvision or another means of
perceiving in darkness has the blinded condition while in darkness, though it might be able to see illuminated areas beyond the darkness. If a creature can see into an illuminated area, it can observe creatures within that illuminated area normally. After being in darkness, sudden exposure to bright light might make you dazzled for a short time, as determined by the GM.
