## Controlling a Mount
While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.

### Controlled Mounts
You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training.

Mounts that do not possess combat training (see the Animal Handling skill) are frightened by combat. If you don't dismount, you must make a DC 20 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check each round as a bonus action to control such a mount. If you succeed, you can perform an action after the bonus action. If you fail, the bonus action becomes an action, and you canâ€™t do anything else until your next turn.

The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it and has only three action options, which must be taken together with the rider: Dash, Disengage and Dodge. If the rider wishes their for their mount to take any other action, then they must use the Animal Handling skill to direct it to do so. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

### Independent Mounts
An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.

### Attacking While Mounted
With a DC 5 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, you can guide your mount with your knees so as to use both hands to attack or defend yourself. This is a free action.

When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on foot, you have advantage on melee attacks for being on higher ground. If your mount moves more than 5 feet, then you can only make a single melee attack as you pass your target. Essentially, you have to wait until the mount gets to your target before attacking, so you can't make multiple attacks vs a single target. However, if you have the Extra Attack class feature, you may attack multiple targets by moving in between. Even at your mount's full speed, you don't take any penalty on melee attacks while mounted.

If your mount charges and you make an attack at the end of the charge, you receive the bonus gained from the charge.

You can use ranged weapons while your mount is dashing, but you suffer disadvantage on the attack roll. You make the attack roll when your mount has completed half its movement. You can use the Extra Attack class feature with a ranged weapon while your mount is moving.

### Casting Spells While Mounted
You can cast a spell normally if your mount moves up to a normal move (its speed) either before or after you cast. If you have your mount move both before and after you cast a spell, then you're casting the spell while the mount is moving, and you have to make a concentration check due to the vigorous motion (DC 10 + spell level) or lose the spell. If the mount is dashing, you can cast a spell when your mount has moved up to twice its speed, but your concentration check is more difficult due to the violent motion (DC 15 + spell level).
