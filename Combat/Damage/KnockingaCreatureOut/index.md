# Knocking a Creature Out
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe by making a non-lethal attack, rather than deal a killing blow. The attacker must make this choice before dealing damage.

All melee weapons may be used to make non-lethal attacks, but they deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus Strength instead of their typical value. Only weapons with the non-lethal property deal their full damage with a non-lethal attack. All improvised weapons have this property if they deal bludgeoning damage.

When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a non-lethal attack, the attacker knocks the creature out. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.
