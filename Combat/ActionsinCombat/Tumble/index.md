# Tumble (<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/14/FFFFFF/action-filled.png"> or <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/14/FFFFFF/plus-math.png"/>)
A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature’s space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity (Athletics) check against the hostile creature’s weapon skill.

If the tumbler succeeds, it can move through the hostile creature’s space once this turn and does not provoke an opportunity attack when leaving the reach of the hostile creature who's space it passed through.

If the mover fails by less than 5, it may still choose to pass through the hostile creature's space. However, it treats the space as difficult terrain and provokes an opportunity attack from the hostile creature.

If the mover fails by 5 or more, it cannot move through the hostile creature's space. 

A creature that attempts to tumble past more than one hostile creature in a single turn suffers disadvantage on all successive Dexterity (Athletics) checks to tumble.
