You can use your object interaction to hold on to a solid object as an anchor. This requires the use of both hands. As long as you maintain your grip, any attempts to move you or knock you prone are made with disadvantage.

Once you are holding on, you can continue to do so as long as you do not release your grip or use your hands for anything else. If you are moved further than 5 feet away from the object, or knocked prone, the effect ends.
