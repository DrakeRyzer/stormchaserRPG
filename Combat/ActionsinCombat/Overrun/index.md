# Overrun (<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/14/FFFFFF/action-filled.png"> or <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/14/FFFFFF/plus-math.png"/>)
When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature’s space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action, or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength (Athletics) check against the higher of the hostile creature’s weapon skill and passive Strength (Athletics) score. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.

If the mover succeeds, it can move through the hostile creature’s space once this turn and does not provoke an opportunity attack when leaving the reach of the hostile creature who's space it passed through.

If the mover fails by less than 5, it may still choose to pass through the hostile creature's space. However, it treats the space as difficult terrain and provokes an opportunity attack from the hostile creature.

If the mover fails by 5 or more, it cannot move through the hostile creature's space. 

A creature that attempts to overrun more than one hostile creature in a single turn suffers disadvantage on all successive Strength (Athletics) checks to overrun.
