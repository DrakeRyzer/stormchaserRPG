# Help <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/14/FFFFFF/action-filled.png">
As an Action, you can aid an ally's next ability check, helping them achieve success on their ability check by making the same kind of ability check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character that you are helping receives advantage on their own check. You can't take 10 on an ability check to Help.

Multiple creatures can help the same target and similar bonuses stack.
