# Charge (<img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/exercise.png"> and <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/14/FFFFFF/action-filled.png">)
If you spend your movement for a turn to move at least 20 feet towards a target and finish your movement within reach of it, then you may declare a charge attack as an action. You must have a clear path towards your target, and nothing may hinder your path (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). Choose one of these options:

**Strike.** You may make a single melee attack with advantage. The attack deals additional damage equal to the distance you charged divided by 5, up to your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice, minimum of 1). If you are riding a mounted animal that provides the movement instead of you, you must use its Strength or Constitution instead.

**Slam.** You may perform a shove attack with advantage. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target. If you succeed, the creature is shoved twice the normal distance, or shoved as normal and then knocked prone. You may choose to move up to five feet in the direction you are shoving your target. 

**Tackle.** You may make a single grapple attempt with advantage. If the grapple fails, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target and are knocked prone. If you succeed, both you and your opponent are knocked prone and your target is subjected to the Grappled condition.
