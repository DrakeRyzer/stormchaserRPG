# Ready (Varies)
Readying lets you prepare to take an Action later, after your turn is over, but before your next turn has begun. To do so, specify the Action that you will take and the circumstances under which you will take it. Then, any time before your next turn, you may take the Readied Action in response to those circumstances (assuming they occur).
