# Surprise
A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the stealth checks of anyone hiding with the passive perception score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.

When attacking a surprised target, the target cannot use its stamina to avoid [injury](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/Injuries/). On a hit, it must roll on the [injury](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/DamageandHealing/Injuries/) table. If a natural 20 is rolled, then the target is knocked [unconscious](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Unconscious/) and must begin making death saves as though at 0 stamina.

## Ready to Strike
Even if you are outside of combat, you may declare that you are "ready to strike" at any creatures that you can see and observe their behaviour for longer than 6 seconds, and you have your weapon readied to Attack at the start of your first combat turn. Any activity other than observing the creatures breaks your concentration and you lose this benefit unless you spend 6 seconds to ready again.

While Ready to Strike, you cannot be surprised by the creatures you observe.
