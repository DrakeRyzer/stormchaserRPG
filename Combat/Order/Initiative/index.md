# Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. If you roll a natural 20 on initiative you gain one free Hit Die, which may be spent on exertion (as described under Hit Points) without loss of hit points. 

The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time. 

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the combatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier (highest first). If the tied characters and monsters have the same initiative modifier, then they can each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.

## Initiative Rush
Sometimes a few points of initiative prevent the cleric from saving the fighter's life before he makes his last death save, or, if a fighter could move up the initiative order, he could act before the enemy and deal the final blow. When you want to achieve such feats, you can rush your initiative. 

At any time between your combat turns, you may announce that you want to rush your next turn. If you do so, you can raise your initiative for this round only by your proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier. During your rushed turn you may use only your Movement or your Action but not both.

## Delaying Initiative
By choosing to delay, you take no action and then act normally on whatever initiative count you decide to act. When you delay, you voluntarily reduce your own initiative result for the rest of the combat. When your new, lower initiative count comes up later in the same round, you can act normally. You can specify this new initiative result or just wait until some time later in the round and act then, thus fixing your new initiative count at that point.

You never get back the time you spend waiting to see what’s going to happen. You also can’t interrupt anyone else’s action (as you can with a readied action).

### Initiative Consequences of Delaying
Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the delayed action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed an action, you don’t get to take a delayed action (though you can delay again).

If you take a delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.
