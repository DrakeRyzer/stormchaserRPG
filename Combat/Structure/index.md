## Structure
An encounter is played out in a series of rounds, during which the player characters, adversaries and other participants in the encounter act in sequence. You roll initiative to determine this order at the start of the encounter and then play through rounds until a conclusion is reached and the encounter ends. The rules in this section assume a combat encounter (a battle), but the general structure can apply to any kind of encounter.
