# Step 1: Start Your Turn
Many things happen automatically at the start of your turn; it’s a common point for tracking the passage of time for effects that last multiple rounds. At the start of each of your turns, take these steps in any order you choose:
* If you created an effect lasting for a certain number of rounds, reduce the number of rounds remaining by 1. The effect ends if the duration is reduced to 0. For example, if you cast a spell that lasts 3 rounds on yourself during your first turn of a fight, it would affect you during that turn, decrease to 2 rounds of duration at the start of your second turn, decrease to 1 round of duration at the start of your third turn, and expire at the start of your fourth turn.
* You can use 1 free action with a trigger of "your turn begins", or something similar.
* If you’re dying, make a recovery check.
* Do anything else that is specified to happen at the start of your turn, such as regaining stamina from fast healing or regeneration.

The last step of starting your turn is always the same:
* Regain your 3 actions. You can’t "save" actions from one turn to use during the next turn. Some abilities or conditions (such as quickened, slowed, and stunned) can change how many actions you regain. If you lose actions and gain additional actions (such as if you’re both quickened and slowed), then you choose which actions to lose.
