# Step 2: Act
You can use actions in any order that you wish during your turn, but you must complete one action or activity before beginning another. For example, you can’t use a single action in the middle of performing a 2-action activity. What actions you can use often depend on your skills, talents and equipment, but there are default actions that anybody can use, described in [Basic Actions](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/) below. Some effects might prevent you from acting. If you can’t act, then you can’t use any actions, including free actions.

On your turn, you can begin a 2-action or 3-action activity that you will complete on a subsequent turn. For example, you can begin to cast a 2-action spell using your final action on one turn and then complete it as your first action on your next turn.

Once you have spent all 3 of your actions, your turn ends (as described in [Step 3](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Turns/End/)) and the next creature’s turn begins. However, if you wish, you may choose to use only some of your actions and end your turn early. As soon as your turn ends, you lose all of your remaining actions, but not your ability to use free actions.

## Defending in Melee
When engaged in melee, you are by default assumed to use the higher of your Strength defence (blocking attacks) and Dexterity defence (evading attacks). If you wish to use the lower of the two for the duration of the next round, because you are facing foes that have +1d to hit your primary defence, then you must declare it on your turn. This decision is a free action.
