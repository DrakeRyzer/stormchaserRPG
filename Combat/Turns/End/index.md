# Step 3: End Your Turn
Once you’ve done all of the things that you want to do with the actions that you have available, then you reach the end of your turn. Take the following steps in any order you choose. Play then proceeds to the next creature in the initiative order.
* End any effects that last until the end of your turn. For example, spells with a sustained duration end at the end of your turn unless you used the Sustain a Spell action during your turn to extend them. Some effects caused by enemies might also last through a certain number of your turns, and you decrease the remaining duration by 1 during this step, ending the effect if its duration is reduced to 0.
* If you have a persistent damage condition, you take the damage at this point. After you take the damage, you can attempt the flat check to end the persistent damage. You then attempt any defence checks for ongoing afflictions. Many other conditions change at the end of your turn, such as the frightened condition decreasing in severity. These take place after you’ve taken any persistent damage, attempted flat checks to end the persistent damage, and attempted defence checks against any afflictions.
* You can use 1 free action with a trigger of "your turn ends", or something similar.
* When engaged in melee, you are by default assumed to use the higher of your Strength defence (blocking attacks) and Dexterity defence (evading attacks). If you wish to use the lower of the two for the duration of the next round, because you are facing foes that have +1d to hit your primary defence, then you must declare it by the end of your turn. This decision is a free action.
* Resolve anything else specified to happen at the end of your turn.
