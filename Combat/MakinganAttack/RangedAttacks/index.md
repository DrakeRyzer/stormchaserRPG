# Ranged Attacks
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.

## Range
You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.

## Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.

### Aim <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/exercise.png">
If your target hasn't moved during its previous turn, you can spend your movement to stand still, hold your breath and aim with a ranged weapon. Until the end of this turn, your next ranged attack against that target has advantage.

Aiming requires an instance of concentration, which can result in exhaustion.

### Disarm <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
A creature can use a ranged weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll with disadvantage. If the attack hits, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker suffers an additional instance of disadvantage on their attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands.

### Distract <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
You can aid another character's attack by forcing an enemy to avoid your own attacks, making it more difficult for them to avoid your ally. Select an enemy and make an attack against a Dexterity defence of 10 (modified by cover). If you succeed, you grant advantage to allied attack rolls against that opponent until the start of your next turn.

Multiple creatures can distract the same target and similar bonuses stack.

### Drive Back <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
Using one of your attacks, you attempt to force back a standing creature. Make an attack roll with disadvantage. If it hits, the target backs away from you by 5 feet.

### Pin <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
When you make an attack with a bow, you may attempt to pin a Large or smaller creature to a wall or surface by catching their clothing with the arrow’s point. At the GM's discretion, this attack option may under some circumstances be used against creatures without clothing. Make an attack roll with disadvantage and, if the attack hits, compare the roll to the target's Strength defence. On a hit, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the arrow is removed. On its turn, the target may spend an action to make a Strength defence check vs the archer's weapon skill to free itself.

### Suppress <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
You can keep the pressure on an enemy, making their attacks more difficult. Select an opponent and make an attack against a Dexterity defence of 10 (modified by cover). If you succeed, that opponent suffers disadvantage on its attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

Multiple creatures can suppress the same target and similar bonuses stack.
