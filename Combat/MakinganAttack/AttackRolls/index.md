# Attack Rolls
When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Dexterity defence, the attack hits. The Dexterity defence of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the Dexterity defence of a monster is in its stat block.

> ## Choosing to be Hit
> Sometimes, an attack might miss you when you wanted it to hit. You can choose to allow a miss to hit you (no action required). If you do so, the attacker chooses the maximum amount of damage instead of rolling.

## Modifiers to the Roll
When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, the modifier is provided in its stat block.

### Ability Modifier
The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spel1 attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spel1caster, as explained in chapter 10.

### Proficiency Die
You add your proficiency die to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon or spell with which you have proficiency.

### Positioning
When you attack a creature in melee from higher ground, you have advantage to hit.

When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on foot, you get the same advantage on melee attacks for being on higher ground.

## Rolling 1 or 20
Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's defence. In addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's defence.
