# Damage and Healing
Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore the world of Arden. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of f1ame from a *fireball* spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

# Hit Points
Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to O hit points.

## Exertion
Sometimes, hit points can be deliberately spent to put extra effort into a specific action. When a player wishes to do this, they roll a hit die, apply this number as a modifier to an associated roll and take the same amount of damage, which cannot be reduced in any way. Although this is generally a matter for GM fiat, here are some examples and suggested cases:

* Adding to the to attack roll of a weapon attack.
* Adding to the damage of an attack or spell.
* Adding to the effect of a healing spell.
* Adding a number of five foot squares to a move.

Spellcasting is a special case. When rolling a HD to boost the attack roll of a spell, the player must multiply the damage they take by the spell's level (1 for cantrips).

A HD rolled by a half caster or subclass caster to boost a spell's attack roll provides only one half or one third of the benefit, respectively.

## Damage Rolls
Each weapon, spell and harmful monster ability specifies the damage that it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier (the same modifier used for the attack roll) to the damage. A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts *fireball* or a cleric casts *flame strike*, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

### Damage Types
Different attacks, damaging spells and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

#### Acid
The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

#### Bludgeoning
Blunt force attacks (hammers, falling and constriction) deal bludgeoning damage. Melee attacks that deal bludgeoning damage have advantage to hit targets defending with Strength defence and disadvantage to hit targets defending with Dexterity defence.

#### Cold
The infernal chill from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.

#### Fire
Red dragons breathe fire and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

#### Force
Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including *magic missile* and *spiritual weapon*.

#### Lightning
A *lightning bolt* spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage. 

#### Necrotic
Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as *chill touch*, withers matter and even the soul.

#### Piercing
Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage. 

#### Poison
Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage. 

#### Psychic
Mental abilities such as a mind flayer's psionic blast deal psychic damage. 

#### Radiant
Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's *flame strike* spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power. 

#### Slashing
Swords, axes and monsters' claws deal slashing damage. Melee attacks that deal slashing damage have advantage to hit targets defending with Dexterity defence and disadvantage to hit targets defending with Strength defence.

#### Thunder
A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the *thunderwave* spell, deals thunder damage.

### Describing The Effects Of Damage 
Game Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury, or knocking you unconscious.

### Critical Hits
When you score a critical hit, you get a bonus to the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice and add them to the maximum possible roll for a normal attack. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 1d4+4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you add the maximum value of those dice as well.

### Massive Damage
When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, the attacker makes an additional attack roll with a bonus of +5 vs the creature's Constitution defence. On a hit, the creature suffers a random effect determined by a roll on the System Shock table. For example, the Constitution defence of a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 is attacked if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

###### System Shock

| 1d10 | Effect |
|:----:|:-------|
| 1 | The creature drops to 0 hit points. |
| 2-3 | The creature drops to 0 hit points but is stable. |
| 4-5 | The creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. |
| 6-7 | The creature cannot make opportunity attacks and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8-10 | The creature cannot make opportunity attacks until the end of its next turn. |

## Resistance and Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is increased by 50% against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple Instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type **stack** as follows:

| Instances of Resistance or Vulnerability | Damage Change in Percent (%) |
|:----------------------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| 1 | 50% |
| 2 | 70% |
| 3 | 80% |
| 4 | 85% |
| 5 | 90% |
| 6 | 95% |
| 7 | 100% |

## Injuries
Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. However, if a player wishes to take no hit point damage from a given attack, then they may instead check for a lingering injury.

To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the injury table of the corresponding damage type. These tables assume a typical humanoid physiology, but the results can be adapted for creatures with different body types.

If you roll a 1-3 and have no more body parts of the given type to lose, or if you roll a 4-13 and have already suffered this injury, then you suffer the next worst injury on the table. If you cannot sustain any further injuries, you are dying. 

Resistance to the damage type causing the injury grants advantage on the roll. Vulnerability to the damage type causing the injury imparts disadvantage on the roll. If the roll falls within the range defined by the coverage of your armour, then you may reroll and take the better result.

Fresh injuries are at risk of festering. The first time that you take a long rest after suffering an injury, make a DC 11 Constitution defence check. If your injuries have been cleaned with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check, then you have advantage on this check. If you fail, then you suffer a festering wound in addition to your injury.

Sometimes, a character suffers from an injury that requires a period of natural healing to be removed, such as an internal injury. Days on which a character suffering from such an effect receives magical healing while at maximum hit points, count as two days for the purposes of determining the duration of such injuries.

###### Physical Injuries

| d20 | Injury | 
|:-:|:-|
| 1 | **Lose a Foot or Leg.** Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move, unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage. |
| 2 | **Lose an Arm or Hand.** You can no longer hold anything with two hands and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage. |
| 3 | **Lose an Eye.** You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on melee and ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you are blinded. |
| 4 | **Horrible Scar.** You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as *heal* and *regenerate*, removes the scar. |
| 5-7 | **Limp.** Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity defence check after using the Dash action. If you fail the check, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp. |
| 8-10 | **Festering Wound.** Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. |
| 11-13 | **Major Internal Injury/Neuralgia/Systemic Damage.** Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution defence check. On a failed check, you lose your action and cannot make opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing, or if you spend 10 days resting. |
| 14-16 | **Minor Internal Injury/Neuralgia/Systemic Damage.** This has the same effect as Major Internal Injury/Neuralgia/Systemic Damage above, except the DC is 10. If you already have this injury, it becomes a major injury. |
| 17-19 | **Minor Scar.** The scar doesn't have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as *heal* and *regenerate*, removes the scar. |
| 20 | **Adrenaline Rush.** Roll one hit die and add your Constitution modifier to the result. You heal that number of hit points. If you have more than one class, use the hit die of the class in which you have more levels. If you have the same number of levels in both classes, take the greater. |

###### Psychic Injuries

| d20 | Injury | 
|:-:|:-|
| 1 | **Indefinite Madness.** Roll on the Indefinite Madness table in the Appendix. |
| 2 | **Long-term Madness.** Roll on the Long-term Madness table in the Appendix. |
| 3 | **Short-term Madness.** Roll on the Short-term Madness table in the Appendix. |
| 4 | **Major Tic.** You are mentally damaged to the extent that the scars can't be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as *heal* and *regenerate*, removes the tic. |
| 5-7 | **Brain Damage.** Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity defence check after using the Dash action. If you fail the check, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the brain damage. |
| 8-10 | **Subdural Hematoma.** Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. |
| 11-13 | **Major Headaches.** Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution defence check. On a failed check, you lose your action and cannot make opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing, or if you spend 10 days resting. |
| 14-16 | **Minor Headaches.** This has the same effect as Major Headaches above, except the DC is 10. If you already have minor headaches, they become major headaches. |
| 17-19 | **Minor Tic.** The tic doesn't have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as *heal* and *regenerate*, removes the tic. |
| 20 | **Adrenaline Rush.** Roll one hit die and add your Constitution modifier to the result. You heal that number of hit points. If you have more than one class, use the hit die of the class in which you have more levels. If you have the same number of levels in both classes, take the greater. |

### Siege Injury
This table applies only to impaling, crushing and explosive damage from a siege weapon that dealt more than half your maximum Hit Points in damage and reduce you to 0 hp. Make a simple d20 roll. Roll with advantage if the damage is impaling. Roll with disadvantage if the damage is explosive.

If the siege weapon damage deals damage of more than half your maximum Hit Points, but doesn't reduce you to 0 hp, you instead roll on the physical table.

| d20 | Injury | 
|:-:|:-|
| 1-2 | **You are dead.**  Your remains are reduced to bloody pulp that is unrecognizable without DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check by an ally. If this injury was caused by explosive damage, your remains are burned and unusable for the purpose of the *Resurrection* spell and you can only be returned to life with *True Resurrection* or *Wish* spells. |
| 3-5 | **You are dead.**  Your remains are reduced to a mix of body parts and crushed entrails that is unrecognizable without DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check by an ally. Parts of your body can be used for the *Resurrection* spell. If this injury was caused by explosive damage, a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check is needed to find the part usable for Resurrection spell. |
| 6-8 | **You are dead.**  Your remains are torn into several parts, most of your organs spilled out. Parts of your body can be used for the *Resurrection* spell. Unless this injury was caused by explosive damage, most of your head is intact which allows the use of *Speak with Dead* spell. |
| 9-13 | **You are dead.**  You can be raised back to life with the *Revivify* or *Raise Dead* spells, but you suffer 3 injuries that must be resolved immediately. |
| 14-16 | **You are dying.** You automatically fail 2 of your death saving throws. You suffer 2 injuries that must be resolved immediately. |
| 17-19 | **You are dying.** You automatically fail 1 of your death saving throws. You suffer 1 injury that must to be resolved immediately. |
| 20 | **You are dying.** |

## Healing
Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points (as explained in chapter 8) and magic such as a *cure wounds* spell or a *potion of healing* removes damage instantly.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.

A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the *revivify* spell has restored it to life.

## Dropping to 0 Hit Points
When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

### Instant Death
Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.

For example, a cleric with a maximum of 13 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If they take 19 damage from an attack, they are reduced to 0 hit points, but 13 damage remains. Since the remaining damage equals their hit point maximum, the cleric dies.

### Falling Unconscious
If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see Appendix). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

### Death Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special check, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other checks, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on ability checks.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 11 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.

The number of successful death saving throws is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable. The number of failed death saving throws is reset to zero when you take an extended rest. Alternatively, the spell lesser restoration can remove one failed death saving throw, or the spell greater restoration can remove all failed death saving throws from a creature.

#### Rolling 1 or 20
When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, it counts as two successes.

#### Damage at 0 Hit Points
If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

### Stabilising a Creature
The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilised so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilise it, which requires a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check of DC 15, +5 for every death save that that creature has failed.

A **stable** creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

### Monsters and Death
Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saves.

Mighty villains and special non-player characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.

## Knocking a Creature Out
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe by making a non-lethal attack, rather than deal a killing blow. The attacker must make this choice before dealing damage.

All melee weapons may be used to make non-lethal attacks, but they deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus Strength instead of their typical value. Only weapons with the non-lethal property deal their full damage with a non-lethal attack. All improvised weapons have this property if they deal bludgeoning damage.

When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a non-lethal attack, the attacker knocks the creature out. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.

## Temporary Hit Points
Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.

When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first and any left over damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. 

Since temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points. 

Healing can't restore temporary hit points and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22. 

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilise you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you. 

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.
