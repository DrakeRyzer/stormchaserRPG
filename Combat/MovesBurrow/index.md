# Burrow
*Move*<br>
**Actions:** 1<br>
**Requirements:** You have a burrow speed.

You dig your way through dirt, sand, or a similar loose material at a rate up to your burrow Speed. You canâ€™t burrow through rock or other substances denser than dirt unless you have an ability that allows you to do so.

> ## Breaking Up Your Move
> You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take an action, such as Strike, and then move 20 feet.
> 
> ## Using Different Speeds
> If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.
> 
> For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the *fly* spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.
