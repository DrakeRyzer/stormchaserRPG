# Size, Space and Reach
Creatures and objects of different sizes occupy different amounts of space. The sizes and the spaces they each take up on a grid are listed in the table below:

| Size | Space | Reach (Tall) | Reach (Long) |
|:----:|:-----:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Tiny       | Less than 5 feet | 0 feet  | 0 feet  |
| Small      | 5 feet           | 5 feet  | 5 feet  |
| Medium     | 5 feet           | 5 feet  | 5 feet  |
| Large      | 10 feet          | 10 feet | 5 feet  |
| Huge       | 15 feet          | 15 feet | 10 feet |
| Gargantuan | 20 feet or more  | 20 feet | 15 feet |

This table also lists the typical reach for creatures of each size, for both tall creatures (most bipeds) and long creatures (most quadrupeds). See [reach]().

The space entry lists how many feet one side of a creature's space is, so a Large creature fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot space (4 squares on the grid). A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

Sometimes part of a creature extends beyond its space, such as if a giant octopus is grabbing you with its tentacles. In that case, the GM will usually allow attacking the extended portion, even if you can’t reach the main creature. A small or larger creature or object takes up at least 1 square on a grid, and creatures of these sizes can’t usually share spaces except in situations like a character riding a mount. Rules for moving through other creatures' spaces appear below.

Multiple tiny creatures can occupy the same square. At least four can fit in a single square, though the GM might determine that even more can fit. Tiny creatures can occupy a space occupied by a larger creature as well, and if their reach is 0 feet, they must do so in order to attack.

## Squeezing into a Smaller Space
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls. Attacks vs the creature's dexterity defence have +1d while it's in the smaller space.
