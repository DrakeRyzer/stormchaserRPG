# Cover
When you’re behind an obstacle that could block weapons, guard you against explosions and make you harder to detect, you’re behind cover. Cover grants you a circumstance bonus to Dexterity defence and to Stealth checks to Hide, Sneak, or otherwise avoid detection. However, **you forego your proficiency bonus to your Dexterity defence**.

There are five degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, then the target has three-quarters cover.

| Type of Cover | Bonus | Can Hide |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:--------:|
| Quarter       | +2 | No |
| Half          | +4 | Yes |
| Three-Quarter | +6 | Yes |
| Full          | +8 | Yes |

Cover can be increased by one step using the Take Cover basic action. If cover is especially light, typically when it’s provided by a creature, you have quarter cover. A creature with half cover or three-quarter cover can attempt to use Stealth to Hide, but quarter cover isn’t sufficient.

Cover is relative, so you might simultaneously have cover against one creature and not another. Cover applies only if your path to the target is partially blocked. If a creature is entirely behind a wall or the like, you don’t have line of effect and typically can’t target it at all.

Usually, the GM can quickly decide whether your target has cover. If you’re uncertain or need to be more precise, draw a line from the center of your space to the center of the target’s space. If that line passes through any terrain or object that would block the effect, the target has half cover (or three-quarter cover if the obstruction is extreme or the target has Taken Cover). If the line passes through a creature instead, the target has quarter cover. When measuring cover against an area effect, draw the line from the effect’s point of origin to the center of the creature’s space.

If an attack misses a creature only due to a Dexterity defence bonus from cover, the attack hits said cover. If that cover was another creature, that creature suffers the effects of the attack.

## Quarter Cover
A target with **quarter cover** has a +2 cover bonus to Dexterity defence, but may not add its proficiency bonus to its Dexterity defence for as long as it takes advantage of the cover. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least one quarter of its body. The obstacle might be a small piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a smaller creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

## Half Cover
A target with **half cover** has a +4 bonus to Dexterity defence, but may not add its proficiency bonus to its Dexterity defence for as long as it takes advantage of the cover. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, or a creature of the same size, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

## Three-Quarters Cover
A target with **three-quarters** cover has a +6 bonus to Dexterity defence, but may not add its proficiency bonus to its Dexterity defence for as long as it takes advantage of the cover. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, a large arrow slit, a thick tree trunk, or a larger creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

## Full Cover
A target with **full** cover has a +8 bonus to Dexterity defence, but may not add its proficiency bonus to its Dexterity defence for as long as it takes advantage of the cover. A target has full cover if almost all of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a narrow arrow slit, or a corner that you are only peering around.

## Total Cover
A target with **total** cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
