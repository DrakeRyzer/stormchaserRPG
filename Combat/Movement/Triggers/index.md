# Move Action Triggers
Some free actions are triggered by a creature using an action with the move trait. The most notable example is the [Attack of Opportunity]() (the moving creature must succeed at a defence check vs the hostile creature's weapon skill, or be hit by a strike). 

Actions with the move trait can trigger free actions throughout the course of the distance traveled. Each time you exit a square (or move 5 feet if not using a grid) within a creature’s reach, your movement triggers those free actions (although no more than once per move action for a given creature acting). If you use a move action, but don’t move out of a square, the trigger instead happens at the end of that action or ability.

Some actions, such as Step, specifically state that they don't trigger free actions based on movement.
