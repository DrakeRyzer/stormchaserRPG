# Forced Movement
When an effect forces you to move, or if you start falling, the distance that you move is defined by the effect that moved you, not by your speed. Since you’re not acting to move, this doesn’t trigger free actions that are triggered by movement.

If forced movement would move you into a space that you can’t occupy (for example, because objects are in the way, or because you lack the movement type needed to reach it) you stop moving in the last space that you can occupy. Usually, the creature or the effect forcing the movement chooses the path that the victim takes. If you’re pushed or pulled, then you can usually be moved through hazardous terrain, pushed off a ledge, or the like. Abilities that reposition you in some other way can’t put you in such dangerous places unless they specify otherwise. In all cases, the GM makes the final call if there’s doubt on where forced movement can move a creature.
