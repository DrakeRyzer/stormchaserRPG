# Stand
*Move*<br>
**Actions:** 1

You stand up from [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/).

If you are [Supine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Supine/), then standing requires that you either succeed at a DC 10 [Athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check, or you must spend 5 feet of your movement to [Turn](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Turn/) from [Supine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Supine/) to [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/).

## Standing Up in Melee
Rising from a throw or fall in the heat of battle is difficult. To do so quickly takes training and skill. This is an even greater challenge when under attack.

When you stand while in melee range of hostile creatures, make an [Athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check with a DC of 10 + 2 for each enemy for whom you are within reach. If you are [Supine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Supine/), this DC increases by 5. If you beat the DC to stand by 5 or more, you may also choose to tumble 5 feet into an unoccupied space and stand up there.

If you fail, then you must succeed at a defence check vs the weapon skill of each hostile creature individually. Failure results in being hit by an [attack of opportunity](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/MakinganAttack/MeleeAttacks/#opportunity-attacks). If any defence check fails by 10 or more, then you are knocked [Supine](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Supine/).
