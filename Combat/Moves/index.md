# Movement Actions
Movement Actions, put simply, are how you move through your surroundings during combat or in any other time where a character's choices are constrained to a turn-by-turn basis. Some of these actions will be used very regularly, while others may only be applicable when a character benefits from a special movement type (ex. Flying).
