# Movement Actions
Movement actions are how you navigate your surroundings during combat, or at any other time when actions are counted individually. Some of these actions will be used very regularly, while others may only be applicable when a character benefits from a special movement type (e.g. [Fly](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Fly/)).
