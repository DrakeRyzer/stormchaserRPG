# Seek
*Concentrate, Secret*<br>
**Actions:** 1

You scan an area for signs of creatures or objects. If you're looking for creatures, choose an area you're scanning. If precision is necessary, the GM can have you select a 30-foot cone or a 15-foot burst within line of sight. You might take a penalty if you choose an area that's far away.

If you’re using seek to search for objects (including secret doors and hazards), you search up to a 10-foot square adjacent to you. The GM might determine that you need to seek as an activity, taking more actions or even minutes or hours, if you're searching a particularly cluttered area.

Make an [investigation](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Investigation/) check. The GM compares the result to the [stealth](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Stealth/) DCs of any [undetected](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#undetected) or [hidden](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#hidden) creatures in the area, or the DC to detect each object in the area (as determined by the GM, or by someone [concealing the object](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Stealth/Conceal/)). A creature you detect might remain [hidden](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#hidden), rather than becoming [observed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#observed), if you’re using an [imprecise sense](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Senses/#imprecise-senses), or if an effect (such as invisibility) prevents the subject from being observed.

**Critical Success:** If you were searching for creatures, any [undetected](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#undetected) or [hidden](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#hidden) creature that you critically succeeded against becomes [observed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#observed) by you. If you were searching for an object, you learn its location.

**Success:** If you were searching for creatures, any [undetected](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#undetected) creature you succeeded against becomes [hidden](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#hidden) from you instead of [undetected](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#undetected) and any [hidden](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#hidden) creature that you succeeded against becomes [observed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Awareness/Detecting/#observed) by you. If you were searching for an object, you learn its location or get a clue to its whereabouts, as determined by the GM.
