# Cast a Spell (Varies)
Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a bonus action, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses their action in combat to cast such a spell. See [the rules on spellcasting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spellcasting/).
