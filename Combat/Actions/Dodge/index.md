# Dodge
**Actions:** 2

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, if you can see the attacker, then you have +1d to your defences vs melee and ranged attacks. You lose this benefit if you are [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/), or if your speed drops to 0.
