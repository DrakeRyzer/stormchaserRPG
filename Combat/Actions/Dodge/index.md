# Dodge <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/14/FFFFFF/action-filled.png">
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.
