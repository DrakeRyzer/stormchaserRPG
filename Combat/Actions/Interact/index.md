# Interact
*Manipulate*<br>
**Actions:** 1

You use your hand or hands to manipulate an object or the terrain. You can grab an unattended or stored object, open a door, or produce some similar effect. You might have to attempt a skill check to determine if your Interact action was successful.

## Hold On
You can use Interact to hold on to a solid object as an anchor. This requires the use of both hands. As long as you maintain your grip, you have +1d to your defences to resist being moved or knocked prone.

Once you are holding on, you can continue to do so as long as you do not release your grip or use your hands for anything else. If you are moved further than 5 feet away from the object, or knocked prone, the effect ends.
