# Point Out
*Auditory, Manipulate, Visual*<br>
**Actions:** 1<br>
**Requirements:** A creature is undetected by one or more of your allies but isn’t undetected by you.

You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. That creature is [hidden](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Detecting/#hidden) to your allies, rather than [undetected](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Detecting/#undetected). This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target. If your allies can’t hear or understand you, they must succeed at a Perception check against the creature's passive stealth score or they misunderstand and believe that the target is in a different location.
