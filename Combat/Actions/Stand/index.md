# Stand
*Move*<br>
**Actions:** 1

You stand up from prone.

If you are supine, then standing requires that you either succeed at a DC 10 athletics check, or you must [turn]() from supine to prone.

## Standing Up in Melee
Rising from a throw or fall in the heat of battle is difficult. To do so quickly takes training and skill. This is an even greater challenge when under attack.

When you stand while in melee range of hostile creatures, make an athletics check with a DC of 10 + 2 for each enemy for whom you are within reach. If you are supine, this DC increases by 5. If you beat the DC to stand by 5 or more, you may also choose to tumble 5 feet into an unoccupied space and stand up there.

If you fail, then you must succeed at a defence check vs the weapon skill of each hostile creature individually. Failure results in being hit by an [opportunity attack](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/MakinganAttack/MeleeAttacks/#opportunity-attacks). If any defence check fails by 10 or more, then you are knocked supine.
