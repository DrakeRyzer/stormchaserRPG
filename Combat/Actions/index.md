# Basic Actions
Basic actions represent common tasks like moving around, attacking and helping others. As such, every creature can use basic actions except in some extreme circumstances and many of those actions are used very frequently. Most notably, youâ€™ll use Interact, Step, Stride, and Strike a great deal. Many talents and other actions call upon you to use one of these basic actions or modify them to produce different effects. For example, a more complex action might let you Stride up to double your speed instead of just up to your speed and a large number of activities include a Strike.

In addition to the actions in these two sections, the actions for spellcasting can be found [here](), and the actions for using magic items appear [here]().
