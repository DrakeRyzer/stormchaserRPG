# Guard
**Actions:** 1<br>
**Requirements:** The ally is willing to accept your aid.

You can defend a creature within 5 feet of you. When you take the Guard action, you focus entirely on preventing attacks from reaching your ally. Until the start of your next turn, any the guarded ally has +1d to its defences vs melee and ranged attacks if you can see the attacker, as long as the ally is within 5 feet of you.

Additionally, when you take this action, you can declare that, if an attack would hit the guarded ally, you will instead have it hit you (no action required). If you do so, the attack deals the maximum amount of damage instead of rolling.
