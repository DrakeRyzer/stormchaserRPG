# Take Cover
**Actions:** 1<br>
**Requirements:** You are benefiting from cover, are near a feature that allows you to take cover, or are prone.

You press yourself against a wall or duck behind an obstacle to take better advantage of [cover](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Movement/Cover/). If you would have standard cover, you instead gain greater cover. Otherwise, you gain the benefits of standard cover.

This lasts until you move from your current space, use an attack action, become unconscious, or end this effect as a free action.
