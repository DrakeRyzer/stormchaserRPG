# Take Cover
**Actions:** 1<br>
**Requirements:** You are benefiting from cover, are near a feature that allows you to take cover, or are prone.

You press yourself against a wall or duck behind an obstacle to take better advantage of [cover](). If you would have quarter cover, then you instead gain half cover, which provides a +4 circumstance bonus to Dexterity defence and to Stealth checks to Hide, Sneak, or otherwise avoid detection. Otherwise, you gain the benefits of standard cover (a +2 circumstance bonus instead). This lasts until you move from your current space, use an attack action, become unconscious, or end this effect as a free action.
