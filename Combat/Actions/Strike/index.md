# Strike
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

You attack with a weapon that you are wielding, targeting one creature within your reach (for a melee attack) or within range (for a ranged attack). Roll the attack roll for the weapon or unarmed attack that you are using and compare the result to the target creature's Dexterity defence to determine the effect (creatures attacked in melee may instead choose to use their Strength defence). See [Attack Rolls](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Specific/Attack/) and [Damage](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Damage/) for details on calculating your attack and damage rolls.

**Critical Success:** As success, but you deal additional damage (see [the rules for critical hits](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Damage/Roll/#critical-hits)).

**Success:** You deal damage according to the weapon attack, including any modifiers, bonuses, and penalties that you have to damage.

> ## Damaging Your Weapon
> It is possible to push your weapon beyond its limits to achieve great effect, damaging it in the process. When you hit with a melee weapon, you may choose to deal maximum damage and your weapon takes the same amount damage (see [Breaking an Object](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/Objects/#breaking-an-object)).
