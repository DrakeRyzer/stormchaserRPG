# Strike
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

You attack with a weapon that you're wielding, targeting one creature within your reach (for a melee attack) or within range (for a ranged attack). Roll the attack roll for the weapon or unarmed attack that you are using and compare the result to the target creatureâ€™s defence to determine the effect. See [Attack Rolls]() and [Damage]() for details on calculating your attack and damage rolls.

**Critical Success:** As success, but you deal damage (see [the rules for critical hits]()).

**Success:** You deal damage according to the weapon attack, including any modifiers, bonuses, and penalties that you have to damage.
