# Aid
**Actions:** 1<br>
**Requirements:** The ally is willing to accept your aid.

You try to help your ally with a task. You must explain to the GM exactly how you’re trying to help and they determine whether you can Aid your ally.

When you use the Aid action, attempt a skill check or attack roll of a type decided by the GM. The typical DC is 15, but the GM might adjust this DC for particularly hard or easy tasks. The GM can add any relevant traits to your Aid action depending on the situation, or even allow you to Aid checks other than skill checks and attack rolls.

You can't take 10 on a check to Aid.

Multiple creatures can Aid the same target and the benefits stack.

**Critical Success:** You grant your ally +2d to the check.

**Success:** You grant your ally +1d to the check.

**Critical Failure:** Your ally takes –1d to the check.
