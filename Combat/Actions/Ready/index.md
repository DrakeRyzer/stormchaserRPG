# Ready
*Concentrate*<br>
**Actions:** Equal to the readied action.

You prepare to use an action that will occur outside your turn. Choose a single action or free action that you can use and designate a trigger. Your turn then ends. If the trigger that you designated occurs before the start of your next turn, you can use the chosen action as a free action (provided that you still meet the requirements to use it). You can’t Ready a free action that already has a trigger.

If you have a multiple attack penalty and your readied action is an attack action, then your readied attack takes the multiple attack penalty that you had at the time you used Ready. This is one of the few times that the multiple attack penalty applies when it’s not your turn.
