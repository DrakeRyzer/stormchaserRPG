# Mounting and Dismounting
Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an 5 feet of movement, plus an additional 5 for every size category of the mount above tiny. For example, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a large horse. Therefore, you can't mount it if you don't have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.

A horse (not a pony) is a Large creature and thus takes up a space 10 feet (2 squares) across. For simplicity, assume that you share your mount's space during combat.

## If Your Mount Falls in Battle
If your mount falls unconscious or is knocked prone, you automatically attempt to dismount as it falls. An attack roll with a bonus of +5 is made vs your passive Dexterity (Athletics) score. On a miss, you fall softly and take no damage. On a hit, you are dismounted, fall prone in a space within 5 feet of your mount and take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage.

## If Your Mount Is Moved Against Its Will
If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity defence check or fall off the mount, as described above. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same check.

## If You Are Dropped
If you are knocked unconscious, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (75% if you are in a military saddle). Otherwise you fall and take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Without you to guide it, your mount avoids combat.
