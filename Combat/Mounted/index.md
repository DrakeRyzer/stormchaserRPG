# Mounted Combat
A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a c1eric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide. A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.
