# Cover
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are five degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, then the target has three-quarters cover.

Cover can be enhanced by one step by taking the **take cover** action.

If an attack misses a creature only due to a Dexterity defence bonus from cover, the attack hits said cover. If that cover was another creature, that creature suffers the effects of the attack.

## Quarter Cover
A target with **quarter cover** has a +2 cover bonus to Dexterity defence, but may not add its proficiency bonus to its Dexterity defence for as long as it takes advantage of the cover. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least one quarter of its body. The obstacle might be a small piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a smaller creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

## Half Cover
A target with **half cover** has a +4 bonus to Dexterity defence, but may not add its proficiency bonus to its Dexterity defence for as long as it takes advantage of the cover. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, or a creature of the same size, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

## Three-Quarters Cover
A target with **three-quarters** cover has a +6 bonus to Dexterity defence, but may not add its proficiency bonus to its Dexterity defence for as long as it takes advantage of the cover. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, a large arrow slit, a thick tree trunk, or a larger creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

## Full Cover
A target with **full** cover has a +8 bonus to Dexterity defence, but may not add its proficiency bonus to its Dexterity defence for as long as it takes advantage of the cover. A target has full cover if almost all of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a narrow arrow slit, or a corner that you are only peering around.

## Total Cover
A target with **total** cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
