# Moving Around Other Creatures
You can move through a non-hostile creature's space. However, you can only move through a hostile creature's space if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you must succeed at a defence check vs the hostile creature's weapon skill (10 + their attack bonus), or be hit by an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.
