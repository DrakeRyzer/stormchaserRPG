# Playing on a Grid
If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.
 
**Squares.** Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.
 
**Speed.** Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5 foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed
of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.

If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.

**Entering a Square.** To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left.  

If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.

**Corners.** Diagonal movement can't cross the corner of a wall, large tree, aor other terrain feature that fills its space.

**Ranges.** To determine the range on a grid between two things (whether creatures or objects) start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.

## Diagonals
When measuring range or moving diagonally on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 feet, but the second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you're counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. For example, a character might move one square diagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight (15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total movement of 30 feet.

## Flanking
Flanking gives combatants a simple way to gain advantage on attack rolls against a common enemy.

A creature can't flank an enemy that it can't see. A creature also can't flank while it is incapacitated. A Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least one square of its space qualifies for flanking.

When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy.

When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures' spaces. If the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, the enemy is flanked.

Optionally, a flanked creature may choose one of the attackers that are flanking it and deny them the benefit of flanking. However, all other attackers receive an additional die of advantage. The chosen attacker may be changed as part of the creature's movement on its turn.
