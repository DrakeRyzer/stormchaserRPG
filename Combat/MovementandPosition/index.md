## Movement and Position
In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your **speed**, which is determined as follows:

<center><strong>Speed in Feet = ( Strength Score + Dexterity Score )</strong></center>

rounded down to the nearest multiple of five.

For example:

| Strength | Dexterity | Speed |
|:--------:|:---------:|:-----:|
| 2 | 2 | 5 Feet |
| 3 | 4 | 10 Feet |
| 4 | 6 | 15 Feet |
| 6 | 8 | 20 Feet |
| 8 | 9 | 25 Feet |
| 10 | 10 | 30 Feet |
| 10 | 14 | 35 Feet |
| 10 | 17 | 40 Feet |
| 12 | 18 | 45 Feet |
| 16 | 18 | 50 Feet |
| 19 | 18 | 55 Feet |
| 20 | 20 | 60 Feet |

You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

The [Special Types of Movement section](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/Movement/SpecialTypesofMovement/) gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.
