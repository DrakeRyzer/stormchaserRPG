# Special Battles
Sometimes fights occur while the characters are atop mounts or when the PCs take to the sky or seas.

## Three-Dimensional Combat
In aerial and aquatic combat, you might need to track positioning in three dimensions. For flying creatures, you might use one of the following methods:
* Find platforms to place flying creaturesâ€™ miniatures on.
* Set a die next to a creature with the number indicating how many squares up in the air it is.
* Make a stack of dice or tokens, 1 per 5 feet of elevation.
* Write the elevation next to the monster on the grid.

In underwater combat, choose a plane to be the baseline, typically the waterline, the sea floor, or a stationary object that you can measure from.

As with ground-based movement, moving diagonally up or down in 3-D space requires counting every other diagonal as 10 feet. Measure flanking in all directions. Creatures above and below an enemy can flank it just as effectively as they can from opposite sides.
