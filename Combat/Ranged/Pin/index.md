# Pin
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

You may attempt to use a ranged weapon to pin a Large or smaller creature to a wall or surface by catching their clothing with the projectile's point. The weapon may not be a firearm and must deal piercing damage. At the GM's discretion, this option may under some circumstances be used against creatures without clothing.

Make an attack roll with -1d and, if the attack hits, compare the roll to the target's Strength defence. On a hit, the targetâ€™s speed is reduced to 0 until the arrow is removed. On its turn, the target may spend an action to make a Strength check vs your weapon skill to free itself.
