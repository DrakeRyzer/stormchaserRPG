# Disarm
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

A creature can use a ranged weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll with -1d. If the attack hits, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker suffers an additional instance of disadvantage on their attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands.
