# Suppress
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

You can keep the pressure on an enemy, making their attacks more difficult. Select an opponent and make an attack against a Dexterity defence of 10 (modified by cover). If you succeed, that opponent suffers -1d on its attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

Multiple creatures can suppress the same target and similar bonuses stack.
