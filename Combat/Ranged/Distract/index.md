# Distract
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

You can aid another character's attack by forcing an enemy to avoid your own attacks, making it more difficult for them to avoid your ally. Select an enemy and make an attack against a Dexterity defence of 10 (modified by cover). If you succeed, you grant +1d to allied attack rolls against that opponent until the start of your next turn.

Multiple creatures can distract the same target and similar bonuses stack.
