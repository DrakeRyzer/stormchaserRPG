# Your Turn
On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**. Vou decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed (sometimes called your walking speed) is noted on your character sheet.

The most common actions you can take are described in [the "Actions in Combat" section](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/ActionsinCombat/). Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.

[The "Movement and Position" section](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/MovementandPosition/) gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready
action, as described in "Actions in Combat".

## Bonus Actions
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.

Normally, you can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available. Alternatively, you may also forgo your action to take a second bonus action that turn.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions
also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

## Defending in Melee
When engaged in melee, you are by default assumed to use the higher of your Strength defence (blocking attacks) and Dexterity defence (evading attacks). If you wish to use the lower of the two for the duration of the next round, because you are facing foes that have advantage to hit your primary defence, then you must declare it on your turn. This decision has no action cost.

## Other Activity on Your Turn

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object, paired set (twin blades/sword and shield) or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack. When switching weapons, if both weapons are easily accessible, this counts as a single item interaction.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

Items carried by a character are considered to either be Readied or Stowed:
* Readied items are those that the character is wearing at all times, or that they have conveniently to hand in sheaths, holsters, or belt pouches. A character can draw or produce a Readied item using their item interaction.
* Stowed items are carried in backpacks, in carefully-balanced leg or arm pockets, or otherwise packed away where they will least encumber the character. If a character needs to get out a Stowed item in a hurry, they must use their Action to dig it out of their pack or pockets.

> ### Interacting with Objects Around You
> Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:

> * Put your ear to a door
