# Charge
*Attack, Move*<br>
**Actions:** 3

With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. You must have a clear path towards your target and nothing may hinder your path (such as difficult terrain or obstacles).

Stride twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, choose one of the following options:
* **Strike:** You may make a single melee attack with +1d. The attack deals additional damage equal to the distance you charged divided by 5, up to the greater of your Strength and Constitution modifiers. If you are riding a mounted animal that provides the movement instead of you, you must use the greater of its Strength or Constitution instead.
* **Slam:** You [Shove](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Shove/) with +1d. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target. If you succeed, the creature is moved twice the normal distance, or moved as normal and then knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/). You may choose to move up to five feet in the direction that you move your target. 
* **Tackle:** You may make a single [Grapple](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Grapple/) attempt with +1d. If the [Grapple](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Grapple/) fails, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target and are knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/). If you succeed, both you and your opponent are knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/) and your target is subjected to the [Grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) condition.

You can use Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
