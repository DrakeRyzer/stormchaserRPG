# Power Attack
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

When you take the [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action using your Strength modifier, you can choose to take -1d to the attack roll and attempt to put more of your raw strength behind a powerful blow. 

If the attack hits, you roll the damage dice twice and take the better result. Additionally, the target is [Staggered](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Staggered/) until the beginning of your next turn.

If you miss, you are [Flat-Footed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Flatfooted/) until the beginning of your next turn.
