# Power Attack
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

Before you make an attack with a melee weapon using your Strength modifier, you can choose to suffer disadvantage on the attack roll and attempt to put more of your raw strength behind a powerful blow. If the attack hits, you roll the damage dice twice and take the better result.
