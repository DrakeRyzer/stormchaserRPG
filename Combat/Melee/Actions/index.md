### Coup de Grace <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
When you make an attack that qualifies as an automatic critical hit against a defenceless target, roll a regular Attack roll against a defence of 10. If you hit, the creature takes damage equal to the total of its current stamina and is dying. If you do not hit, the creature instead loses half its current stamina. If your attack roll would critically hit a normal target, the creature dies immediately.

### Damage Weapon
It is possible to push your weapon beyond its limits to achieve great effect, damaging it in the process. When you hit with a melee weapon, you may choose to turn the hit into a critical hit and your weapon takes the same amount damage (see [Breaking an Object](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/InteractingWithObjects/#breaking-an-object)).

> #### Blocking With An Item
> A weapon or shield can be pushed beyond its limits, damaging it in the process. When you make a Strength defence check to block an attack, you may choose to brace your weapon or shield against the threat. The item takes the damage that the attack would deal to you (see [Breaking an Object](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/InteractingWithObjects/#breaking-an-object)) and you benefit from advantage on the Strength defence check.

### Disarm <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's weapon skill. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item. You can use your item interaction to either kick the weapon into an adjacent area (your choice) or take the item if you have a free hand, otherwise the target may use its item interaction on their turn to take it back.

The attacker has disadvantage on their attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The attacker has advantage on their attack roll if they are larger than the target, or disadvantage if they are smaller than the target.

### Distract <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
You can aid another character's attack by forcing an enemy to avoid your own attacks, making it more difficult for them to avoid your ally. Select an enemy and make an attack against a Dexterity defence of 10 (modified by cover). If you succeed, you grant advantage to allied melee and ranged attack rolls against that opponent until the start of your next turn.

Multiple creatures can distract the same target and similar bonuses stack.

### Drive Back <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
Using one of your attacks, you attempt to force back a standing creature. The target must be no larger than you in size. Make an attack roll vs the target's weapon skill. If you win the contest, the target backs away from you by 5 feet. As part of this attack, you can move 5 feet in the direction of the target.

### Feint <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/14/FFFFFF/plus-math.png"/> (not Unwieldy)
Before you make an attack with a melee weapon that you are proficient with, you can spend your bonus action and perform a feint to deceive your target.

Make an attack roll or a Charisma (Deception) check opposed by the higher of the target's passive insight or weapon skill.

If you succeed, you have advantage on your next attack. If you fail you have disadvantage on the next attack roll and you cannot succeed a Feint against this target for the rest of the encounter.

### Fight Dirty <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png"> (Free Hand)
Fighting dirty refers to a number of dishonourable tricks that exploit common weaknesses. 

You can change one of your attacks into a dirty move from the list below. Make a Strength (Athletics) check vs your target's passive Wisdom (Insight) score. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your opponent. If you succeed, apply the dirty move effect.

#### Head Lock
The target is grappled by you and [suffocating](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/Suffocating/) until the grapple is broken.

#### Eye Jab
The target is Blinded until the end of its next turn. You may also shove the creature as part of the Dirty Trick, but at disadvantage.

#### Groin Shot
The target is Stunned until the end of its next turn. You may also shove the creature as part of the Dirty Trick, but at disadvantage.

Once you use a dirty move against a target, you cannot succeed with the same move again vs that target during the same encounter.

### Grapple <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making an unarmed attack roll vs the target's unarmed weapon skill. If your target is smaller than you, you have advantage. If the target is larger than you, you have disadvantage. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see Appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

#### Escaping a Grapple
A grappled creature can use one Attack as part of an attack action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on an unarmed attack roll vs your Strength or Dexterity defence (you choose the ability to use). If you are proficient in athletics, then you are considered to be proficient in your chosen defence for the purposes of grappling.

#### Moving a Grappled Creature
When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

#### Body-Shield
While a creature is restrained by you, you can use your object interaction to make a Strength (Athletics) check vs that creature's passive Strength (Athletics) score in order to position it in such a way that it shields you from one or more hostile creatures that you are aware of. If the creature is of your size it provides half cover, or, if the creature is one size larger than you, three-quarters cover.

If the creature you shield yourself with becomes stunned, paralysed or unconscious, make a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC of 15, +5 for each size category above yours. On a failure, you do not benefit from the cover.

#### Stealth Grapple
While hidden from your target and all nearby targets, you can perform a grapple check with advantage. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target. If you succeed, you may follow it with one of the following moves. The move applies for as long as the stealth grapple is maintained. For as long as the stealth grapple is maintained, creatures other than the target have advantage on melee and ranged attack rolls to hit the grappler.

##### Gag
You gag the target's mouth to prevent it from making any sound. Make a second grapple check vs your target. On a success, the target is gagged until the grapple ends. A gagged creature cannot cast spells with verbal components and its speech is muffled and difficult to understand.

##### Choke Hold
The attacker grabs the creature by the throat and prevents it from breathing. Make a second grapple check with disadvantage. On a success, the target is gagged and [suffocating](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/Suffocating/) until the grapple ends.

##### Silent Takedown
If your target is already grappled and gagged, you may attempt to strike it with a weapon with the concealed, close or light property. Make a grapple check to maintain the hold on your target. If you succeed, you can make a single special melee attack. Your target has vulnerability towards the damage dealt by that attack.

#### Stealth Drag
While you are grappling a creature that is unable to speak, you may attempt to hide. The stealth check is made at disadvantage. On a success, the movement speed penalty from dragging a grappled creature does not apply.

### Lunge <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png"> (Piercing, not Unwieldy or Light)
You can make a special melee weapon attack that extends the reach of your weapon by 5 feet. You provoke opportunity attacks from enemies within 5 feet of you.

### Power Attack <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
Before you make an attack with a melee weapon using your Strength modifier, you can choose to suffer disadvantage on the attack roll and attempt to put more of your raw strength behind a powerful blow. If the attack hits, you roll the damage dice twice and take the better result.

### Shove <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
Using the attack action, you can make a special melee attack to either knock a creature prone or to push it away from you. If you're able to make multiple
attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of a shove must be no more than one size larger than the attacker and must be within their reach. The attacker makes an unarmed attack roll vs the target's unarmed weapon skill.  If your target is smaller than you, you have advantage. If the target is larger than you, you have disadvantage. If you hit, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.

Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to force a target to the side, rather than away from them. They have disadvantage on their Strength (Athletics) check when they do so. If the check is successful, they move the target 5 feet to a different space within your reach.

### Stagger <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png"> (Bludgeoning)
Before you make a melee attack with a bludgeoning  weapon, you can choose to suffer disadvantage on the attack roll and try to disrupt the movement of your target while attacking.

If the target takes damage, the target's movement speed <br>is reduced by 10 until the end of its next turn. If its speed is reduced to 0 in this way, it immediately drops prone. Until the target recovers its movement speed to full it cannot use the Dash, Disengage and Dodge actions.

### Sunder <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png"> (Martial Axe or Sundering)

You can attempt to sunder an item held or worn by your opponent in place of a melee attack. If your attack is successful, you deal damage to the item normally. Damage that exceeds the object's Damage Reduction is subtracted from its integrity. If an object has equal to or less than half its total integrity remaining, it gains the [broken](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Broken/) condition. If the damage you deal would reduce the object to less than 0 integrity, you can choose to [destroy](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Destroyed/) it. If you do not choose to destroy it, the object is left with only 1 integrity and the broken condition.

When sundering armour, only the outermost layer is the one that gains the broken condition.

If an item is magical, add +2 to its DR and +10 to its integrity for for each rarity category (see [Magic Item DR and Integrity](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/InteractingWithObjects/#magic-item-dr-and-integrity)).

The integrity value given is for armour and shields sized for a medium creature. Divide this number by 2 for each size category of the item smaller than Medium, or multiply it by 2 for each size category larger than Medium.

### Suppress <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png">
You can keep the pressure on an enemy, making their attacks more difficult. Select an opponent and make an attack against a Dexterity defence of 10 (modified by cover). If you succeed, that opponent suffers disadvantage on its attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

Multiple creatures can suppress the same target and similar bonuses stack.

### Trip <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/14/FFFFFF/sword.png"> (Reach or Polearm)

While wielding a melee weapon with the Reach property, or any Polearm weapon, you can spend one of your attacks to perform the Shove a Creature action. Make an Attack roll instead of a Strength (Athletics) check.

### Two-Weapon Fighting <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-glyphs/14/FFFFFF/plus-math.png"/>
When you take the Attack action and attack with a close or light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different close or light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand.

Alternatively, when you take the Attack action and attack with a finesse melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different melee weapon with the close weapon property that you're holding in the other hand.

You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.
