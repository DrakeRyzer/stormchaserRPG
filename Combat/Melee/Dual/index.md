# Dual Wield
When you take the [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) action and attack with a close or light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) again using a different close or light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand, without suffering the multiple attack penalty.

Alternatively, when you [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) with a finesse melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) again with a different melee weapon with the close weapon property that you're holding in the other hand, without suffering the multiple attack penalty.

You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the off-hand attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, then you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.
