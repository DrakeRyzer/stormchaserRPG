**Actions:** 1

*You perform a feint to deceive your target.*

Make an attack roll or a [Deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) check opposed by the higher of the target's passive [Insight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Insight/) or weapon skill. On a hit, you have +1d on your next attack roll with a melee weapon vs that target. On a miss, you have -1d on your next attack roll with a melee weapon vs that target and you cannot succeed with the Feint action against this target for the rest of the encounter.
