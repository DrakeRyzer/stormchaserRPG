# Trip
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

Make an unarmed attack roll vs the target's unarmed weapon skill. If your target is smaller than you, you have +1d. If the target is larger than you, you suffer -1d. On a hit, the target is knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/.)

The target of a trip may be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach.

Critical Success: The target takes 1dM physical damage for every critical hit die.
