# Sunder
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

You can attempt to sunder an item held or worn by your opponent. If your attack is successful, you deal damage to the item normally. Damage that exceeds the object's Damage Reduction is subtracted from its Integrity. If an object has equal to or less than half of its total integrity remaining, it gains the [Broken](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Broken/) condition. If the damage you deal would reduce the object to less than 0 integrity, you can choose to [Destroy](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Destroyed/) it. If you do not choose to destroy it, the object is left with only 1 integrity and the [Broken](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Broken/) condition.

When sundering armour, only the outermost layer gains the broken condition.

If an item is magical, add +2 to its DR and +10 to its integrity for for each rarity category (see [Magic Item DR and Integrity](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/Objects/#magic-item-dr-and-integrity)).

The integrity value given is for armour and shields sized for a medium creature. Divide this number by 2 for each size category of the item smaller than Medium, or multiply it by 2 for each size category larger than Medium.
