# Shove
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

*You make a special melee attack to push a creature away from you.*

Make an unarmed attack roll vs the target's unarmed weapon skill.

You can also attempt to force a target to the side, rather than away from you. If you do so, you suffer -1d on you attack roll.

If your target is smaller than you, you have +1d. If the target is larger than you, you suffer -1d. The target of a shove may be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach.

**Success:** The target is pushed 5 feet away from you (or 5 feet to a different space within your reach, if forced to the side).

**Critical Success:** The target is pushed an additional 5 feet for every additional hit in your dice pool.
