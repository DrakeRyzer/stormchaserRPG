# Shove
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

*You make a special melee attack to either knock a creature prone or push it away from you.*

Make an unarmed attack roll vs the target's unarmed weapon skill. If your target is smaller than you, you have +1d. If the target is larger than you, you suffer -1d. On a hit, you push the target 5 feet away from you.

Alternatively, you can attempt to force a target to the side, rather than away from you. You suffer -1d on you attack roll when they do so. If the check is successful, then you move the target 5 feet to a different space within your reach.

The target of a shove may be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach.

Critical Success: The target is pushed an additional 5 feet for every critical hit result in the check.
