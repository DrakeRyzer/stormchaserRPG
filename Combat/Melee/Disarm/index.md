# Disarm
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

*You use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp.*

Make an attack roll vs the target's weapon skill. On a hit, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item. You can use the [Interact](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Interact/) action to either kick the weapon into an adjacent area (your choice of direction), or take the item if you have a free hand, otherwise the target may use the [Interact](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Interact/) action on its turn to take the item back.

You have -1d on your attack roll to disarm if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. You have +1d on your attack roll to disarm if you are larger than the target, or -1d if you are smaller than the target.
