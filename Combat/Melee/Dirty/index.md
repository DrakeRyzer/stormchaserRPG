# Fight Dirty
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

*You use a dishonourable trick that exploits a common weakness.* 

Choose one of the moves from the list below and make an unarmed attack vs your target's passive [Insight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Insight/) score. On a miss, you provoke an [Attack of Opportunity](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Movement/Triggers/#attack-of-opportunity) from your opponent. On a hit, apply the move's effect.

Once you use a move against a target, you cannot succeed again with that move vs the same target during the same encounter.

## Head Lock
The target is grappled by you and [suffocating](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/Suffocating/) until the grapple is broken.

## Eye Jab
The target is [Blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/) until the end of its next turn. You may also [Shove]() the creature as part of this move, but you suffer -1d to the attack roll.

## Groin Shot
The target is [Stunned](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Stunned/) until the end of its next turn. You may also [Shove]() the creature as part of this move, but you suffer -1d to the attack roll.
