# Grapple
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use make a special melee attack called a grapple.

The target of your grapple may be no more than one size larger than you and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making an unarmed attack roll vs the target's unarmed weapon skill. If your target is smaller than you, you have +1d to the attack roll. If the target is larger than you, you suffer -1d to the attack roll. On a hit, you subject the target to the [Grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

## Escaping a Grapple
A grappled creature can use the [Escape](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Escape/) action to escape.

## Moving a Grappled Creature
When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

## Body-Shield
While a creature is restrained by you, you can use the Grapple action to position it in such a way that it shields you from one or more hostile creatures that you are aware of. On a hit, the creature provides [cover](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Movement/Cover/) if it is of your size. If the creature is one size larger than you, it provides greater cover.

If the creature that you are shielding yourself with becomes stunned, paralysed or unconscious, make an [Athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/) check with a DC of 15. If the creature is a size category larger than you, then the DC is 20. On a failure, you do not benefit from the cover.

## Stealth Grapple
While hidden from your target and all nearby targets, you can perform a grapple attack. On a miss, you provoke an [Attack of Opportunity](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Movement/Triggers/#attack-of-opportunity) from your target. On a hit, you may follow the grapply with one of the following moves. For as long as the stealth grapple is maintained, the move applies and creatures other than the target have +1d on melee and ranged attack rolls to hit the grappler.

### Gag
You gag the target's mouth to prevent it from making any sound. Make a second grapple attack vs your target. On a success, the target is gagged until the grapple ends. A gagged creature cannot cast spells with verbal components and its speech is muffled and difficult to understand.

### Choke Hold
The attacker grabs the creature by the throat and prevents it from breathing. Make a second grapple check with disadvantage -1d. On a success, the target is gagged and [suffocating](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/Suffocating/) until the grapple ends.

### Silent Takedown
If your target is already grappled and gagged, you may attempt to strike it with a weapon with the concealed, close or light property. Make a grapple check to maintain the hold on your target. On a hit, you can make a single special melee attack. Your target has vulnerability towards damage dealt by that attack.

### Stealth Drag
While you are grappling a creature that is unable to speak, you may attempt to hide. The [Stealth](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Stealth/) check suffers -1d. On a success, the movement speed penalty from dragging a grappled creature does not apply.
