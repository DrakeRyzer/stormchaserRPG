# Stagger
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

*You make a special melee attack with a bludgeoning weapon to disrupt the movement of your target.*

Make a melee attack roll with -1d. If the target takes damage, then its movement speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn. If the target's speed is reduced to 0 in this way, it immediately drops prone. Until the target recovers, it cannot use the [Dodge](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Dodge/), [Step](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Step/) and [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Step/) actions.
