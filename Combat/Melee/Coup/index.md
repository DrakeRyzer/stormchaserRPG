# Coup de Grace
*Attack, Manipulate*<br>
**Actions:** 3

When you make an attack that qualifies as an automatic critical hit against a defenceless target, roll a regular Attack roll against a defence of 10. If you hit, the creature takes damage equal to the total of its current stamina and is dying. If you do not hit, the creature instead loses half its current stamina. If your attack roll would critically hit a normal target, the creature dies immediately.
