# Suppress
*Attack*<br>
**Actions:** 1

*You keep the pressure on an enemy, making their attacks more difficult.*

Select a creature and make an attack against a Dexterity defence of 10 (modified by cover). If you succeed, that opponent suffers -1d on its attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

Multiple creatures can suppress the same target and similar bonuses stack.
