# Hit Points
Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to O hit points.

## Exertion
Sometimes, hit points can be deliberately spent to put extra effort into a specific action. When a player wishes to do this, they roll a hit die, apply this number as a modifier to an associated roll and take the same amount of damage, which cannot be reduced in any way. Although this is generally a matter for GM fiat, here are some examples and suggested cases:
* Adding to the to attack roll of a weapon attack.
* Adding to the damage of an attack or spell.
* Adding to the effect of a healing spell.
* Adding a number of five foot squares to a move.

Spellcasting is a special case. When rolling a HD to boost the attack roll of a spell, the player must multiply the damage they take by the spell's level (1 for cantrips).

A HD rolled by a half caster or subclass caster to boost a spell's attack roll provides only one half or one third of the benefit, respectively.
