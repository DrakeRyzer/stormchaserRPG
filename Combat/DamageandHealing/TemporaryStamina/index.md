# Temporary Stamina
Some spells and special abilities confer temporary stamina to a creature. Temporary stamina isn't actual stamina; it is a buffer against damage, a pool of stamina that protect you from injury.

When you have temporary stamina and take damage, the temporary stamina is lost first and any left over damage carries over to your normal stamina. For example, if you have 5 temporary stamina and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary stamina and then take 2 damage. 

Since temporary stamina is separate from your actual stamina, it can exceed your stamina maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full stamina and receive temporary stamina. 

Healing can't restore temporary stamina and they can't be added together. If you have temporary stamina and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary stamina when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22. 

If you have 0 stamina, receiving temporary stamina doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilise you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you. 

Unless a feature that grants you temporary stamina has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.
