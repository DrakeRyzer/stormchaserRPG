# Damage Resistance and Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is increased by 50% against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple Instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type **stack** as follows:

| Instances of Resistance or Vulnerability | Damage Change in Percent (%) |
|:----------------------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| 1 | 50% |
| 2 | 70% |
| 3 | 80% |
| 4 | 85% |
| 5 | 90% |
| 6 | 95% |
| 7 | 100% |
