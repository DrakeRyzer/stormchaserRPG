# Necromancy

## In the Clay Container, Life Reborn
*6th level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Hour<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You must have access to the corpse of a creature with its head attached before you can cast this spell. As a part of the casting, cover the corpse in clay. The next day, the creature will be reborn, healed of all ailments and wounds. 

## Soul Cage
*6th level Necromancy*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A tiny silver cage worth 100 gp.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

You can cast this spell when a humanoid that you could see died within 60 feet of you within the last round. You snatch its soul as it dies and trap it inside the tiny cage that you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. 

While you have a soul inside the cage and you are holding the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid that it came from can’t be revived.

**Steal Life.** You can use 2 actions to drain vigour from the soul and regain 2d8 stamina.

**Query Soul.** You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

**Borrow Experience.** You can use 1 action to bolster yourself with the soul’s life experience, granting a +1d to your next attack roll, defence or ability check. If you don't use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

**Eyes of the Dead.** You can use 2 actions to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence that you're currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you sustain the effect, up to 10 minutes (as if you were sustaining a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses. A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using *see invisibility* or *truesight*) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.

## Unluck of the Doomsday
*6th level Necromancy*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Special<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Stare at the creature whom you are cursing and roll 1d8. In a number hours equal to the roll, the creature must succeed at a Wisdom defence check vs your necromancy spell skill. On a failure, if it has less than 20 stamina it will die.
