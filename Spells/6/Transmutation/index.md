# Transmutation

## Investment of Translucent Alabaster
*6th Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, your body is encased in flakes of white stone, and you gain the following benefits:
* You have resistance to necrotic damage, immunity to all disease and, as long as you have at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d8 hit points at the start of each of your turns.
* You can understand all languages and speak them with perfect diction.
* You act with more conviction, gaining advantage on all Charisma checks.
* You gain mastery over all swarms of creatures. They will do your bidding when ordered as if magically charmed.

## Ironwood
*6th level Transmutation (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 minute/lb created<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M (wood to be transformed)<br>
**Duration:** 2 Weeks

This spell creates an *ironwood* object weighing up to 70 lbs. *Ironwood* is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, *ironwood* is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on *ironwood*. Spells that affect wood do affect *ironwood*, although *ironwood* does not burn. Using this spell with the wood shape spell or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids.

Further, if you make only half as much *ironwood* as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.

## Serve
*6th level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a word of power. This utterance forces the world to serve you. You can use this spell to part water up to 10" deep, or lower the water level of a body of water by 50%. You can create weather of any kind, or raise up great walls 100 feet tall and 500 feet wide. Casting this spell allows only one of these feats to be achieved.
