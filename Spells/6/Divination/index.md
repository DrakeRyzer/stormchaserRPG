# Divination

## Destiny, Rewritten
*6th level Divination*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

As a part of this spell's casting you must know the birth place of a creature that is within 120 feet of you. The creature's birth place is changed, and thus its entire life path is changed. The creature's memories are rewritten, as is their personality and alignment, and they disappear, reappearing somewhere else in the world.
