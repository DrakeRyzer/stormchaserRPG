# Conjuration

## Chain One's Fate to a Demon's Own
*6th level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

You must know the true name of a demon to cast this spell. You must also anoint a creature in strange oil as a part of this spell's casting. The anointed creature is possessed with a demon whose true name you announce. The demon will lie sleeping within the anointed creature. Should the creature ever die, the demon shall be released to do battle with all that is hostile towards you until it is slain or banished.

## Idols of Bestial Gods
*6th level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You must have fashioned from clay an animal the size of a small hut before casting this spell. This spell is cast on this idol. The idol turns into a flesh-and-blood version of itself; intelligent, sentient and speaking all languages. It has stamina equal to 3 times your spellcasting attribute score. It will serve you loyally as a sage or as a warrior. When it attacks, make a melee conjuration attack roll and it deals 3d6 damage of a type appropriate to its form on a hit. The animal has all the traits of whatever animal you sculpted it after. When it dies, is dispelled, or is exorcised, it turns into clay and shatters.
