# Divination

## Destiny, Rewritten
*6th level Divination*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 100 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

As a part of this spell's casting you must know the birth place of a creature within 100 feet. The creature's birth place is changed, and thus its entire life path is changed. The creature's memories are rewritten, as is their personality and alignment, and they disappear, reappearing somewhere else in the world.
