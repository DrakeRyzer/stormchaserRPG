# Illusion

## Fear
*3rd Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self (30-Foot Cone)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A white feather or the heart of a hen.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

You project a phantasmal image of a creatureâ€™s worst fears. Make an illusion spell attack roll vs the Wisdom defence of each creature in a 30-foot cone. On a hit, the creatures drop whatever they are holding and become [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) for the duration.

While [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) by this spell, a creature must [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/) and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom defence check. On a successful check, the spell ends for that creature.
