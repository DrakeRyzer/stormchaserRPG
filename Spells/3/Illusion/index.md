## Fear
*3rd Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self (30-Foot Cone)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A white feather or the heart of a hen.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

You project a phantasmal image of a creatureâ€™s worst fears. Make an illusion attack roll vs the Wisdom defence of each creature in a 30-foot cone. On a hit, the creatures drop whatever they are holding and become [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) for the duration.

While [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) by this spell, a creature must [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/) and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom defence check. On a success, the spell ends for that creature.

## Fear
*3rd Level Illusion [Ritual]*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Mintue<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a [riding horse](), except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use 1 action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.
