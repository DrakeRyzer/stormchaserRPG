# Charms

## Motivational Speech
*3rd level Charm*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** 60 ft<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

You address allies, staff, or innocent bystanders to exhort and inspire them to greatness, whether they have anything to get excited about or not. Choose up to five creatures within range that can hear you. For the duration, each affected creature gains 10 temporary hit points and attacks vs their Wisdom defence suffer -1d. If an affected creature takes damage, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes. One round after an affected creature loses the temporary hit points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 mana or more, the temporary hit points increase by 5 for each point of mana beyond the first.

## Psychic Spy
*3rd Level Charm*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Special, see text.

With this spell, you can try to steal the elation from the mind of one humanoid that you can see within 60 feet. Make a charm attack roll vs the Charisma defence of the target. On a hit, you can steal one beneficial effect that they currently possess, such as an ongoing spell (as long as its level is equal to or less than the level that psychic spy was cast at), temporary hit points, or possession of a Bardic Inspiration die. The effect ends for the target and transfers to you for the remainder of its normal duration. If the effect is being sustained, you must sustain it instead of the original caster.
