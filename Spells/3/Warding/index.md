# Warding

## Dispel Magic
*3rd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make warding spell ability check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the mana that you used.

### Counterspell
As a special use of the dispel magic spell, you may attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell as a free action. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, it makes a spell skill check using the skill of spell school being cast modified by the spell's level vs your warding spell skil, modified by *counterspell*'s level. On a failure, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.

For example, if a level wizard with 18 intelligence casts a 3rd level *counterspell* vs a 5th level *cone of cold* spell cast by a Mage with 17 intelligence, the Mage makes a proficient roll with an attack bonus of:

<center>

<strong>+4 Intelligence +5 <em>cone of cold</em> spell level = +9 attack bonus</strong>

</center>

vs a DC of:

<center>

<strong>10 +4 Intelligence +4 proficiency +3 <em>counterspell</em> level = DC 21</strong>

</center>

You can only *counterspell* when another creature that you can see casts a spell within 60 feet of you. In order to be ready to *counterspell*, you must on your own turn declare the conditions under which you will cast *counterspell*. If you wish to upcast *counterspell* then you must declare this in advance. You may only cast *counterspell* once per round.

The conditions must be specific. For example:
* I will *counterspell* the first spell that the mage casts.
* I will *counterspell* at 6th level the first evocation spell that the lich casts.
* I will *counterspell* the first spell attempting to heal the hobgoblin warlord.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, the targeted spellcaster's defence is reduced as described above.

## Exorcise the Hated Evil
*3rd level Ward (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A polished opal worth at least 1000 gp.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Make an melee attack roll vs a creature that is posessed or under the influence of a minor curse. On a hit, you grab the creature by the throat and press a polished opal to its forehead.

Make a warding attack roll against vs the Charisma defence of the posessing creature, or the DC of the curse. On a hit, when you pull the opal back and the curse or entity posessing the creature will exit the creature in the form of black, ichor-filled vomit. Afterwards, the creature is no longer cursed or possessed.
