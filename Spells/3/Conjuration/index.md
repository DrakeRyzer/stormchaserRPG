# Conjuration

## Cozy Cabin
*3rd level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 minute<br>
**Range:** Self (20-foot square)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A tiny log cabin.)*<br>
**Duration:** 12 Hours

You create a a structure around yourself on a solid surface occupying no more that 20 square feet of space with walls up to 10 feet high. The structure can be a simple log cabin, or you can style it to match the environment - a cave grotto, straw roofed roundhut, or a small house in the city. It has one door that does not include a lock, but has a fastener to which a lock can be applied. Other creatures can freely enter and exit the hut without damaging it, but if you exit the hut, the spell ends. You may also end the spell using 1 action.

The interior has a a small fireplace, and comes equiped with 10 bedrolls and cooking utensils, which disappear when the spell ends. You can light a magical fire within the fireplace using 1 action, which can be [sustained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spellcasting/CastingaSpell/Duration/#sustaining-spells) for the duration of the spell. The interior is lit with a small magical light that you can light or extinguish at will using 1 action. The climate inside the hut is comfortable and allows creatures inside it to withstand most hostile weather conditions, but incredible heat or cold, powerful storms, and winds of hurricane force or greater destroy the hut.

## Create Food and Water
*3rd level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn't go bad.

## Passage Through the Underworld
*3th level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

Cover your ears and close your eyes as a part of this spell's casting. Then, walk forward. Your body will descend underground, to a place where no living or undead creature may follow. The following round, appear anywhere within 360 feet of your original location that you can see. When you emerge, one denizen of the underworld - of the GM's discretion - emerges with you, and will aggressively haunt wherever you appear.

## Set Loose the Crocodiles
*3rd level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A moat 20 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and with a radius 30 feet away from you is suddenly carved into the earth and filled with water. If these dimensions cannot be met, then the moat tears through any non-magical obstructions to form itself. Inside of the moat, countless crocodiles. Creatures who attempt to swim or leap across must make an [Athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check or take 1d6 damage as they are pulled in. Creatures in the moat cannot move, and take 3d6 damage every turn until they succeed at the [Athletics](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/) check and can swim out. 

## Transfigure Dust into Vermin
*3rd level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to one minute

Point to a creature within range. Unseen motes of dust that lie upon the creature are turned into lice, rats and scorpions. The vermin swarm them, biting and gnawing, dealing 6d6 piercing damage. This damage continues until the target brings fire to the vermin, or the spell is dispelled.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, the damage increases by 1d6 for each additional mana.
