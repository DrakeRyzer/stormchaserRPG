# Transmutation

## Blink
*3rd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.

## Haste
*3rd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A shaving of licorice root.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +1d to Dexterity defence, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take one of the following: [Crawl](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Crawl/), [Drop Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Drop/), [Interact](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Interact/), [Point Out](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Point/), [Seek](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Seek/), [Speak](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Speak/), [Stand](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stand/), [Step](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Step/), [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/), [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/), [Take Cover](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Cover/).

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

## Inflamed Feet
*3rd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute
 
Billowing flames grant you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 10 feet and moving doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. When you move within 5 feet of a creature or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, it takes 1d6 fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, your speed increases by 5 feet and the spell deals an additional 1d6 fire damage for each additional mana.

## Plant Growth
*3rd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions or 8 Hours<br>
**Range:** 150 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.

If you cast this spell using 2 actions, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.

If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

## Slow
*3rd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 feet (40-foot cube)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A drop of molasses.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Make a transmutation attack vs the Wisdom defence of each target. On a hit, an affected target's speed is halved, it takes a −1d to Dexterity defence. It can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 2 actions, it must first roll a d20. On an 10 or lower, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use 2 actions on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.

A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

## Speak with Plants
*3rd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 10 Minutes

You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant life (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plant life is present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

This spell can cause the plants created by the [Entangle](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Conjuration/#entangle) spell to release a [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) creature.

## Water Breathing
*3rd Level Transmutation [Ritual]*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A short reed or piece of straw)*<br>
**Duration:** 24 Hours

This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.
