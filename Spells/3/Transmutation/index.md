Billowing flames grant you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 10 feet and moving doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks of opportunity. When you move within 5 feet of a creature or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, it takes 1d6 fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, your speed increases by 5 feet and the spell deals an additional 1d6 fire damage for each additional mana.
