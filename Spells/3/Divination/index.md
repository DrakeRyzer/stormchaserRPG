Stare at the sun when you cast this spell and do not look away until you wish it to end. While staring into the sun, you shall see anything that the sun could see, in any part of the world. You can see it as close as if you were 10 feet above ground. After you have looked away from the sun, you are [blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/) for 1d4 hours.

At night this spell has no effect, and it cannot be used indoors.
