# Conjuration

## Beget the Nest of Crowns
*2nd level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (300-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A crown of twigs and feathers.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

*Birds without number cloud the skies and descend.*

Affix upon your brow a crown of twigs and feathers. A large flock of birds is summoned that swarm an area centered on you in a 300-foot radius. The area within the flock is considered heavily obscured and difficult terrain. All creatures inside the flock is considered [deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/) as sound is drowned by their chirping. 

These birds swarm until somehow killed en masse, dispelled, or the crown is removed from your head. 

This spell cannot be used indoors.

## Move the Warlord's Statue
*2nd level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour (Concentration)

A statue of animated stone constructs itself. It stands twice your height and is decorated and painted to mimic that of a famed warlord. It will follow in your footsteps for the spell's duration, or until you command it to take one of the following actions:
* **Attack:** The statue makes a melee spell attack (using your attack bonus) against a target that it can reach with 30 feet of movement. On a hit, this attack deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage.
* **Defend:** The statue absorbs the damage from the next melee or ranged attack that hits you.
* **Lift:** The status will lift one thing weighing 200 lbs. or less.

After any of these acts, the statue will turn into mud and disintegrate.
