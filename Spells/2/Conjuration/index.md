# Conjuration

## Beget the Nest of Crowns
*2nd level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (300-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A crown of twigs and feathers.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 hours

*Birds without number cloud the skies and cover your movements.*

Affix upon your brow a crown of twigs and feathers. A large flock of birds is summoned that swarm an area centered on you in a 300-foot radius. The area within the flock is considered heavily obscured and difficult terrain. All creatures inside the flock are considered [deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/) as sound is drowned by their chirping. 

These birds swarm until somehow killed en masse, dispelled, or the crown is removed from your head. 

This spell cannot be used indoors.

## Move the Warlord's Statue
*2nd level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

A statue of animated stone constructs itself. It stands twice your height and is decorated and painted to mimic that of a famed warlord. It will follow in your footsteps for the spell's duration, or until you use 1 action to command it to take one of the following actions:
* **Attack:** The statue charges to strike. Make a melee conjuration attack against a target that you can see within 30 feet of the statue. On a hit, this attack deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage.
* **Defend:** The statue interposes itself between you and your enemies. This counts as using the [Raise Shield](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Raise/) action, giving you a +3 shield bonus vs melee and ranged attacks until the start of your next turn.
* **Lift:** The status will lift one thing weighing 500 lbs. or less and move it up to 30 feet.

After any of these acts, the statue will turn into mud and disintegrate.
