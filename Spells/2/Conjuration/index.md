# Conjuration

## Beget the Nest of Crowns
*2nd level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (300-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A crown of twigs and feathers.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 hours

*Birds without number cloud the skies and cover your movements.*

Affix upon your brow a crown of twigs and feathers. A large flock of birds is summoned that swarm an area centered on you in a 300-foot radius. The area within the flock is considered heavily obscured and difficult terrain. All creatures inside the flock are considered [deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/) as sound is drowned by their chirping.

These birds swarm until somehow killed en masse, dispelled, or the crown is removed from your head.

This spell cannot be used indoors.

## Find Steed
*2nd level Conjuration (Ritual); Paladin*<br>
**Casting Time:** 5 minutes<br>
**Range:** <br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a *warhorse*, a *pony*, a *camel*, an *elk*, or a *mastiff*. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.

When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time using 1 action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum. Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or carrying.

While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each other telepathically.

You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. Using 1 action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, the following can be summoned as your steed: a *griffon*, a *pegasus*, a *peryton*, a *dire wolf*, a *rhinoceros*, or a *saber-toothed tiger*.

## Misty Step
*2nd level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You disappear in a cloud of mist, teleporting up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

## Move the Warlord's Statue
*2nd level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

A statue of animated stone constructs itself. It stands twice your height and is decorated and painted to mimic that of a famed warlord. It will follow in your footsteps for the spell's duration, or until you use 1 action to command it to take one of the following actions:
* **Attack:** The statue charges to strike. Make a melee conjuration attack against a target that you can see within 30 feet of the statue. On a hit, this attack deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage.
* **Defend:** The statue interposes itself between you and your enemies. This counts as using the [Raise Shield](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Raise/) action, giving you a +3 shield bonus vs melee and ranged attacks until the start of your next turn.
* **Lift:** The status will lift one thing weighing 500 lbs. or less and move it up to 30 feet.
