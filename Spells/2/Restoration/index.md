# Restoration

## Healing Spirit
*2nd level Restoration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 60 feet (5-foot cube)<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

You call forth a spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit takes on a transparent form of your choice.

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a friendly creature that you can see moves into the spirit’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the spirit's space, you can cause the spirit to restore 1dR + you spellcasting modifier stamina to that creature (no action required). The spirit can’t heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 2 + your spellcasting modifier (minimum of three). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

Using 1 action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the number of times the spirit can heal increases by 2.

## Lesser Restoration
