# Illusion

## Invisibility
*2nd Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(An eyelash encased in gum arabic.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes [invisible](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Invisible/) until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, you can target one additional creature for each additional mana.

## Mirror Image
*2nd Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, it must first roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, the attack targets a duplicate on a roll of 6 or higher. With two duplicates, the attack targets a duplicate on a roll of 8 or higher. With one duplicate, the attack targets a duplicate on a roll of 11 or higher.

A duplicate's AC equals 8 plus your illusion proficiency - +4 for trained; +6 for expertise; +7 for mastery. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as [blindsight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/VisionandLight/#blindsight), or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with [truesight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/VisionandLight/#truesight).
