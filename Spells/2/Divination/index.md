# Divination

## Mind Spike
*2nd level Divination*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

You reach into the mind of one creature that you can see within range. Make a divination attack vs the Wisdom defence of the target. On a hit, it takes 3d8 mental damage, or half as much damage on a miss. On a hit, you also always know the target’s location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s [invisible](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Concealment/#invisible), it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the damage increases by 1d8 for each additional point of mana.
