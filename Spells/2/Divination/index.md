# Divination

## Detect Thoughts
*2nd level Divination*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A copper coin.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as an action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

Make a divination attack vs the Wisdom defence of the creature. On a hit, you learn the surface thoughts of the creature, i.e. what is most on its mind in that moment. As part of the action to sustain the spell, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, make a second divination attack vs the Wisdom defence of the creature. If you hit, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If you miss, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind and, unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use 2 actions on its turn to make an Intelligence check vs your divination skill; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures that you cannot see. When you cast the spell, or as part of the action to sustain the spell during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower, or one that doesn't speak any languages.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it. However, it must still be within range.

## Mind Spike
*2nd level Divination*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

You reach into the mind of one creature that you can see within range. Make a divination attack vs the Wisdom defence of the target. On a hit, it takes 3d8 mental damage, or half as much damage on a miss. On a hit, you also always know the target’s location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s [invisible](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/Concealment/#invisible), it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the damage increases by 1d8 for each additional point of mana.
