# Charms

## To This Point, Bring the East!
*2nd level Charm (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A stone stele.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Take a stone stele and affix it into a point of your choosing when you cast this spell. The stele has 10 integrity and DR 6. The spell ends when the stele reduced to zero integrity or until dispelled. 

A creature that attempts to make an attack against you within 30 feet of the stele must first make a Charisma defence check vs your charms spell skill. On a success, the spell has no effect on the creature. On a failure, the creature must spend at least 1 action to Strike the stele as it is drawn to destroy it. 

At the end of each of its turns, a creature affected by this spell can make another Charisma defence check. 

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the integrity of the stele increases by 10 and the DR of the stele increases by 2 for each slot level above 2nd.
