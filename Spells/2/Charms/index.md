# Charms

## To This Point, Bring the East!
*2nd level Charm (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A stone stele worth 50 sp)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Take a stone stele and affix it into a point of your choosing when you cast this spell. The stele weighs 86 lbs, has 45 integrity and DR 8. The spell ends when the stele is reduced to 0 integrity, or until dispelled.

Any creature that attacks you within 20 feet of the stele must first make a Charisma defence check vs your charms skill. On a success, the spell has no effect on the creature. On a failure, the creature is drawn to destroy the stele instead. An affected creature must use its actions to moves towards the stele and damage it.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature affected by this spell can make another Charisma defence check.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the distance from the stele at which the spell is effective increases by 10 feet for every point of mana beyond the first.

## Zone of Truth
*2nd level Charm*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 feet (15-foot radius sphere)<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Make a charm attack vs the Charisma defence of each creature in the area. Additionally, until the spell ends, when a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time must make a Charisma defence check vs your charms skill. On a hit or failed defence check, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
