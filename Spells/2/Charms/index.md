## To This Point, Bring the East!
*2nd level Charm (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A stone stele.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Take a stone stele and affix it into a point of your choosing when you cast this spell. The next creature that attacks you within 100 foot of this stele must succeed at a Charisma defence check or be drawn to destroy it instead.

The stele has 10 integrity and DR 8. The spell ends when it breaks.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature affected by this spell can make another Charisma defence check. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the integrity of the stele increases by 10 and the DR of the stele increases by 2 for each slot level above 2nd.
