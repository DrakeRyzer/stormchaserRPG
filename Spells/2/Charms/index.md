## To This Point, Bring the East!
*2nd level Charm (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A stone stele worth 50 sp)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Take a stone stele and affix it into a point of your choosing when you cast this spell. The stele weighs 86 lbs, has 45 integrity and DR 8. The spell ends when the stele is reduced to 0 integrity, or until dispelled.

Any creature that attacks you within 20 feet of the stele must first make a Charisma defence check vs your charms skill. On a success, the spell has no effect on the creature. On a failure, the creature is drawn to destroy the stele instead. An affected creature must use its actions to moves towards the stele and damage it.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature affected by this spell can make another Charisma defence check.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, the distance from the stele at which the spell is effective increases by 10 feet for every point of mana beyond the first.

## Zone of Truth
*2nd level Charm*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet (20-foot radius sphere)<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 10 Minutes

You designate a spherical zone with a radius of up to 20 foot (smaller at the caster's discretion) centered on a point within range in which creatures are compelled to speak only truth. Creatures within or entering the area have difficulty lying.

When the spell is cast, make a charm attack vs the Charisma defence of each potentially affected creature. When a creature first enters the area, it must make a Charisma defence check vs your charms skill.

If a creature leaves and reenters the area, you nevertheless continue to use the result of the initial roll.

Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment; therefore, they can avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they can be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth.

On a hit or failed defence check, a creature can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies while within the radius. On a critical hit, the target also suffers -1d to [deception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Deception/) checks.
