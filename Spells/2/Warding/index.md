# Warding

## Let the Soul Pass
*2nd level Warding (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 3 actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Oils, salts and strips of linen worth 100gp which the spell consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You prepare a body making it dificult to return to the living.*

You touch the body of a deceased creature, anointing it with the ceremonial oils and salts. If, within the next 10 days, a spell is cast upon it to return it to life, the reviving caster must first succeed on a restoration check vs your warding skill for the creature to return to life. 

## Pass Without Trace
*2nd level Ward*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce.)*<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell at 3rd level, you can concentrate for up to 8 hours. If you use a slot of 5th level or higher, you can concentrate for up to 24 hours.
