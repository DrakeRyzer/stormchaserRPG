# Level 2

## Let the Soul Pass
*2nd level Warding (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 3 actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Oils, salts and strips of linen worth 100gp which the spell consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You prepare a body making it dificult to return to the living.*

You touch the body of a deceased creature, anointing it with the ceremonial oils and salts. If, within the next 10 days, a spell is cast upon it to return it to life, the reviving caster must first succeed on a restoration spell check vs your warding spell skill for the creature to return to life.
