## Blind the Readers of This Tome

**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Incense and a book.)*<br>

Light incense upon a book when you cast this spell. When a creature attempts to read the contents of the book, or attempts to cast a spell that lets them do so, it must make a Constituion defence check vs your necromancy skill. On a failure, they will be blinded for 1d6 days time.
