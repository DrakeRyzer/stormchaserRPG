# Abjuration

## Safeguard
*6th level Abjuration (Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action<br>
**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

In the face of danger, you create a barrier that protects you and those around you. A faintly glowing sphere of protection with a radius of 10 feet appears. The sphere lasts for as long as maintain concentration, or up to 1 minute.

Any spell of a lower level than the Safeguard cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

Furthermore, hazards of the followings type cannot physically pass through the barrier or affect anything within it.

* Physical projectiles
* A specific effect, such as a dragon's breath attack.
* An environmental danger, such as falling rocks or a lava flow.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast Safeguard using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the maximum radius increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 7th.
