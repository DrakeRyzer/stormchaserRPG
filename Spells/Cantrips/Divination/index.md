## Guidance
*Divination Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

*You aid someone by providing them a touch of divine guidance.*

You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target has +1d on a skill check of its choice. The spell then ends.

*A glimpse into the future ensures your next blow strikes true.*

You point a finger at a target in range. You have +1d on your next attack roll against that target, provided that this spell hasn't ended.

The attack ignores circumstance penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to the target being concealed or hidden.

When you learn the [Potent Cantrips](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Mage/#potent-cantrips) feature, the duration increases to 2 rounds.
