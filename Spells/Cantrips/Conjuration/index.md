# Conjuration

## Acid Splash
*Conjuration Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one or two creatures that you can see within range. If you choose two, then they must be within 5 feet of each other. Make a spell attack roll vs the target's Dexterity defence. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier acid damage.

## Create Bonfire
*Conjuration Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Make a spell attack roll vs the Dexterity defence of any creature in the bonfire’s space when you cast the spell. On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make a Dexterity defence check when it moves into the bonfire’s space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failure, the creature takes 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier fire damage.

The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.

## Infestation
**Conjuration Cantrip**<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 30 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A living flea.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature that you can see within range. Make a spell attack roll vs the target's Constitution defence. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks and, if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

## Mage Hand
*Conjuration Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 30 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point that you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

## Poison Spray
*Conjuration Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 10 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. Make a spell attack roll vs the creature's Constitution defence. On a hit, it takes 1d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier poison damage.

## Produce Flame
*Conjuration Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 10 Minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier fire damage.

## Sword Burst
*Conjuration Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (5-Foot Radius)<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a momentary circle of spectral blades that sweep around you. Make spell attack rolls vs all other creatures within 5 feet of you. On a hit, they take 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier force damage.
