# Evocation

## Booming Blade
*Evocation Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** S, M *(A melee weapon.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage and the spell ends.

This spell’s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit and the damage that the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).

## Dancing Lights

You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.

The number of lights created increases by 4 when you reach 5th level (8 lights), 11th level (12 lights), and 17th level (16 lights).
