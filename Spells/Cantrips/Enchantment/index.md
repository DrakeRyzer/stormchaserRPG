# Enchantment

## Encode Thoughts
*Enchantment Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** Up to 8 hours

Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.

If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as detect thoughts or modify memory), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.

Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting detect thoughts on the strand has the same effect.)

This spell’s duration increases to 1 day when you reach 5th level, 1 week when you reach 11th level, and 1 month when you reach 17th level.

## Friends
*Enchantment Cantrip*<br>
*Casting Time:* 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** S, M *(A small amount of makeup applied to the face as this spell is cast.)*<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at one creature of your choice that isn't hostile toward you. When the spell ends, the creature realises that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the GM's discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.

This spell’s duration increases to 10 minutes when you reach 5th level, to 1 hours when you reach 11th level, and to 8 hours when you reach 17th level.

## Mind Sliver
*Enchantment Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** 1 round

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. Make a spell attack roll vs the target's Wisdom defence. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 psychic damage and the next attack roll made against the target before the end of your next turn has advantage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

## Vicious Mockery
**Enchantment Cantrip**<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), make a spell attack roll vs its Intelligence defence. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll that it makes before the end of its next turn.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
