# Warding

## Blade Ward
*Warding Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 round

*You produce a ward that dampens a strike from a weapon.*

You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. Until the end of your next turn, you gain one instance of resistance against bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage dealt by weapon attacks.

When you learn the [Potent Cantrips](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Mage/#potent-cantrips) feature, the spell's duration increases to 2 rounds.

## Resistance
*Warding Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A miniature cloak.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

*You ward a creature against harm.*

Touch one willing creature. The next time before the spell ends that the creature is the target of an attack, that attack roll has -1d. Alternatively, the target has +1d to its next defence check. The spell then ends once one roll is affected.

When you learn the [Potent Cantrips](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/Mage/#potent-cantrips) feature, the spell can affect a second roll within the duration.

## Shield
*Warding Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

*You raise a magical shield of force.*

This counts as using the [Raise Shield](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Raise/) action, giving you a +1 shield bonus vs melee and ranged attacks until the start of your next turn, but it doesn't require a hand to use.

Additionally, until the start of your next turn you take no damage from [Magic Missiles](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Evocation/#magic-missile).
