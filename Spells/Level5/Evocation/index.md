# Evocation

## Temporal Shunt
*5th Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Free Action<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

Make a spell attack roll vs the Charisma defence of a creature that you have seen within the last round. On a hit, it vanishes at the start of its last turn, being thrown to another point in time such that its actions on that turn never happened. At the start of its next turn, the target reappears where it was or in the closest unoccupied space. The target doesn't remember you casting the spell or being affected by it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other.

## Thunderbolt and Lightning
*5th Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You do the fandango and call down a very, very frightening blast of energy, which explodes in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Make a spell attack roll vs the Dexterity defence of each creature in the area. On a hit, a target takes 4d6 thunder and 4d6 lightning damage and becomes frightened of you for the duration; on a miss, it takes half as much damage and is not frightened. A frightened creature can make a Wisdom defence check vs your spell skill at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect for themselves on a success.
