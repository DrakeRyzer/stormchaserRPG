You touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it.

## Pass Without Trace

**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce.)*<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell at 3rd level, you can concentrate for up to 8 hours. If you use a slot of 5th level or higher, you can concentrate for up to 24 hours.
