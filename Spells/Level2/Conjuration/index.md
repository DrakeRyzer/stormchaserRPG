# Conjuration

## Beget the Nest of Crowns
*2nd level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (600-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A crown of twigs and feathers.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Affix upon your brow a crown of twigs and feathers as a part of casting this spell. Birds without number will then cloud the heavens above and descend. All within 600 feet is considered obscured, ranged missiles will not hit their marks, no one can move more than 10 feet per round, and all sound is drowned by their chirping. These birds swarm until somehow killed en masse or dispelled. This spell is useless indoors.

## Move the Warlord's Statue
*2nd level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour (Concentration)

A statue of animated stone constructs itself. It stands twice your height and is decorated and painted to mimic that of a famed warlord. It will follow in your footsteps for the spell's duration, or until you command it to take one of the following actions:
* **Attack:** The statue makes a melee spell attack (using your attack bonus) against a target that it can reach with 30 feet of movement. On a hit, this attack deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage.
* **Defend:** The statue absorbs the damage from the next melee or ranged attack that hits you.
* **Lift:** The status will lift one thing weighing 200 lbs. or less.

After any of these acts, the statue will turn into mud and disintegrate.
