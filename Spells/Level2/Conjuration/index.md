# Conjuration

## Beget the Nest of Crowns
*2nd level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (600-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Affix upon your brow a crown of twigs and feathers as a part of casting this spell. Birds without number will then cloud the heavens above and descend. All within 600 feet is considered obscured, ranged missiles will not hit their marks, no one can move more than 10 feet per round, and all sound is drowned by their chirping. These birds swarm until somehow killed en masse or dispelled. This spell is useless indoors.

## Move the Warlord's Statue
*2nd level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Concentration

A statue of animated stone constructs itself. It stands twice your height and is decorated and painted to mimic that of a famed warlord. It will follow in your footsteps indefinitely, or until you command it to take a single action. If that action is to attack, it will deal 5d6 damage to that which it hits. If that action is to defend, it will absorb the damage from the next attack launched upon its ward. If is to lift, it will lift one thing weighing 10,000 gold coins or less. After any of these acts, it will turn into mud and disintegrate.
