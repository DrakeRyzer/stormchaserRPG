# Necromancy

## Blind the Readers of These Spells
*2nd level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

Upon your spell book, light incense when you cast this spell. When someone attempts to decipher your spell book, or attempts to cast a spell that lets them do so, they will be blinded for 1d6 days time. Even a creature with no training in magic trying to read your spellbook will fall victim to this spell. After 1 creature is cursed in this manner, the spellbook is no longer protected.

## Keep Dead the Dead
*2nd level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Gather the blood of a wounded creature and imbibe it when you cast this spell. The creature cannot ever be brought back from the dead, as its body will turn to sour soil upon death, unfit for the hosting of a soul.
