# Transmutation

## Barkskin
*2nd level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A handful of oak bark.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour (Concentration)

You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target's skin has a rough, bark-like appearance and they gain DR 8 and coverage 1-2, 8-16. The effects of *barkskin* do not stack with worn armour.

## Disfiguring Touch
*2nd level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 3 Days

Make a spell attack vs a creature's Wisdom defence. On a hit, the creature becomes cursed for the duration of the spell. The victim of this spell grows hideously disfigured. The physical appearance of the deformity is subject to the caster’s whim (most demon worshipers choose deformities that reflect their Abyssal patron’s shape or form).

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell's duration increases by 2 days for each slot level above 2nd.

## Dusk that Settles On Mud
*2nd level Transmutation (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

Sprinkle the dust of a black ore onto clay, mud, soil, brick, limestone, or any other earthen substance. It will turn into constricting, hard, black metal and shrink slowly in size. A 10 foot cube of earth can be enchanted in this way. After 1 round, it will have shrunken down to the size of a pebble.

## Enlarge/Reduce
*2nd level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 30 ft<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A pinch of powdered iron.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute (Concentration)

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, make a spell attack vs its Constitution defence. On a miss, the spell has no effect. If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

**Enlarge.** The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks, attacks vs its Strength defence suffer disadvantage, and its walking speed increases by 5 feet. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size and deal 1d4 extra damage.

**Reduce.** The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks, attacks vs its Strength defence benefit from advantage, and its walking speed decreases by 5 feet. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size and deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

## Paper Wings
*2nd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M (A sheet of paper.)<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature while begging them to fly halfway around the world. The target gains a flying speed of 45 feet for the duration. This spell ends early if the target takes fire or radiant damage. When the spell ends, the target comes spiraling down, landing in a random location within a horizontal radius equal to their altitude when the spell ended.

## Wood Shape
*2nd level Transmutation (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*Wood shape* enables you to form one existing piece of wood into any shape that suits your purpose. While it is possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail isn’t possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape that includes moving parts simply doesn't work.

**-(one piece of wood no larger than 25 cu. ft.)*
