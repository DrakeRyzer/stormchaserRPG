# Evocation

## Consecrate/Desecrate
*2nd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A vial of holy water and 25 gp worth of silver dust, all of which must be sprinkled around the area.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

This spell blesses or curses an area. Channel divinity has advantage to hit creatures within this area.

Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a consecrated area. If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, undead creatures within the area suffer disadvantage on attack rolls and other creatures have advantage to hit them.

An undead creature created within or summoned into a desecrated area gains +1 hit point per HD. If the desecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity or aligned higher power, undead creatures within the area gain advantage on attack rolls and other creatures have disadvantage to hit them.

You cannot consecrate/desecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron. Instead, the spell curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above.

## Gust of Wind
Just as for Gust, Gust of Wind can be used to knock targets prone instead of pushing them 5 feet, similarly to the shove action.

## Moonbeam
*2nd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 120 feet (5-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute (Concentration)

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When the spell is first cast and at the end of each of your turns for the spell's duration, any creature within the spell's area is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain. Make a spell attack vs the creature's Constitution defence. On a hit, it takes 2d10 radiant damage, or half as much damage on a miss. Additionally, any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn must also make a Constitution defence check. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed check, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell has advantage to hit shapechangers and they make their defence check with disadvantage. If one is hit or fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
