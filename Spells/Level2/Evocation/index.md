# Evocation

## Binding Ice
*2nd Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (30-foot cone)<br>
**Components:** S,M *(A vial of meltwater.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous
 
A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Make an attack against each creature's Constitution defense in that area. On a hit, a creature takes 3d8 cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a miss, a creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t hindered by ice.
 
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the cold damage by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Consecrate/Desecrate
*2nd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A vial of holy water and 25 gp worth of silver dust, all of which must be sprinkled around the area.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

This spell blesses or curses an area. Channel divinity has advantage to hit creatures within this area.

Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a consecrated area. If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, undead creatures within the area suffer disadvantage on attack rolls and other creatures have advantage to hit them.

An undead creature created within or summoned into a desecrated area gains +1 hit point per HD. If the desecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity or aligned higher power, undead creatures within the area gain advantage on attack rolls and other creatures have disadvantage to hit them.

You cannot consecrate/desecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron. Instead, the spell curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above.

## Gust of Wind
*2nd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A legume seed.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute (Concentration)

For the spell's duration, a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from the spellcaster in a direction of their choice.

When the spell is cast, the spellcaster may choose one of two possible effects:
1. Each creature hit by the spell is pushed 15 feet away from the spellcaster in a direction following the line.
2. Each creature hit by the spell is pushed 10 feet away from the spellcaster in a direction following the line and falls prone after being moved in this way.

When the spell is first case, the spellcaster makes a spell attack roll vs. the Strength defence of each creature in the line. Each creature hit is subject to the effects of the spell.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to the spellcaster.

The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.

As a bonus action on each of the spellcaster's turns before the spell ends, they may change the direction in which the line blasts from them.

## Moonbeam
*2nd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 120 feet (5-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute (Concentration)

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When the spell is first cast and at the end of each of your turns for the spell's duration, any creature within the spell's area is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain. Make a spell attack vs the creature's Constitution defence. On a hit, it takes 2d10 radiant damage, or half as much damage on a miss. Additionally, any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn must also make a Constitution defence check. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed check, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell has advantage to hit shapechangers and they make their defence check with disadvantage. If one is hit or fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
