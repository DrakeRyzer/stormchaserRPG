# Evocation

## Temporal Shunt
*5th Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

Make an evocation spell attack roll vs the Charisma defence of a creature that you have seen within the last round. On a hit, it vanishes at the start of its last turn, being thrown to another point in time such that its actions on that turn never happened. At the start of its next turn, the target reappears where it was or in the closest unoccupied space. The target doesn't remember you casting the spell or being affected by it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 6 or more mana, you can target one additional creature within range for each additional mana. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other.

## Thunderbolt and Lightning
*5th Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet (20-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

*You do the fandango and call down a very, very frightening blast of energy.*

Make an evocation spell attack roll vs the Dexterity defence of each creature in the 20-foot area centered on a point you can see within range. On a hit, a target takes 4d6 sonic and 4d6 electric damage and becomes [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) of you for the duration; on a miss, it takes half as much damage and is not [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/). A [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) creature can make a Wisdom defence check vs your evocation spell skill at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect for themselves on a success.
