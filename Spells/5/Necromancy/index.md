# Necromancy

## Fashion the Chimera
*5th level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Take the body of a dead man and lay the corpse of an animal upon it. Only then may you cast this spell. The two bodies fuse in a way of your choosing. The new creature is risen as a chimera that will faithfully serve you. It has as many HD as you do, and has one aspect of the animal that it is fused with, such as an eagle's wings, a lion's claws, or a shark's water breath. If the chimera is ever exorcised, it dies instantly.

## Keep Dead the Dead
*5nd level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(The blood of a wounded creature.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Gather the blood of a dead creature and imbibe it when you cast this spell. The creature's soul cannot ever inhabit this body, as it will turn to sour soil upon death, unfit for the hosting of a soul.

## Raise Dead
Raise Dead can be cast as a ritual.

## Upon Me I Bestow the Strength of the Dead
*5th level Necromancy*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** 6 Rounds

You may only cast this spell while having the skull of a 4th level or higher fighting-man in your inventory. You gain their Strength score and proficiency bonus, as well as the ability to use all armour, shields and weapons for 6 rounds. 

## Walk Again, Those Countless Dead
*5th level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

To cast this spell, you must have a scrap of flesh from a dead man's face. Once cast, you call forth the dead to serve you. For the number of dead animated simply roll one hit die for every level above the 8th the caster is, thus a level 9 caster gets 1d6 animated dead. Note that the skeletons or dead bodies must be available in order to animate them. The spell lasts until dispelled or the animated dead are done away with.
