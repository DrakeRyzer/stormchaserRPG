# Transmutation

## Hot Ashes To Trees
*5th Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(An unburned match.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell doesn't enable you to tell Heaven from Hell, but it does reverse the combustion process of one object that filled a space no larger than a 10-foot cube before it was burned. You must touch the ashes or other remains of the object when you cast this spell, and all of the object's remains must be present; the spell fails if some of the ashes have been lost for example. After you have finished casting this spell, the target object is restored to whatever condition it was in immediately before it was burned. The spell does not repair damage not caused by fire. This spell can restore life to mundane plants that have been destroyed by fire, but it cannot restore life to any other type of creature.

## Reincarnate
Reincarnate can be cast as a ritual.

## Weather With You
*5th Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Self (5-mile radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M (A small boat made of china.)<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 30 days

You sing like a bird released, allowing you to take the weather with you everywhere you go. When you cast this spell, the current weather conditions (which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season) are fixed in a 5-mile radius around you. These conditions remain constant for the duration of the spell, and stay with you when you move. The weather conditions in the spell's area cannot be changed by any means short of a control weather spell.

When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to its normal variability.
