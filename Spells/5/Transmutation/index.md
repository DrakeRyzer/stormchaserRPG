# Transmutation

## Elemental Body
*5th Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(The element you plan to assume.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 minute

You magically assume the shape of a elemental - air, earth, fire or water. When the duration ends, you revert to your normal form, unless you expend further mana. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using 1 action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 stamina, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply all forms that you take:<br>
* You retain all of your attribute scores and walking speed, though they can be modified as shown below depending on the chosen form. You also retain all your skill and defence proficiencies.
* You can speak as normal while in this form, though the sound of your voice may be altered by the elemental you have chosen.
* You can cast spells if they contain only a verbal component. Transforming doesn’t prevent you from sustaining a spell that you’ve already cast, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you’ve already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your talents, species, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as low-light vision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* Your gear is absorbed into your new form. Any persistent magical bonus granted by the gear still applies, however you cannot use any feature of your gear that requires you to activate it.
* Your stamina and maximum stamina increase by 5 times the amount of mana expended for the duration.

## Hot Ashes To Trees
*5th Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(An unburned match.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell doesn't enable you to tell Heaven from Hell, but it does reverse the combustion process of one object that filled a space no larger than a 10-foot cube before it was burned. You must touch the ashes or other remains of the object when you cast this spell, and all of the object's remains must be present; the spell fails if some of the ashes have been lost for example. After you have finished casting this spell, the target object is restored to whatever condition it was in immediately before it was burned. The spell does not repair damage not caused by fire. This spell can restore life to mundane plants that have been destroyed by fire, but it cannot restore life to any other type of creature.

## Reincarnate
Reincarnate can be cast as a ritual.

## Weather With You
*5th Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Self (5-mile radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M (A small boat made of china.)<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 30 days

You sing like a bird released, allowing you to take the weather with you everywhere you go. When you cast this spell, the current weather conditions (which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season) are fixed in a 5-mile radius around you. These conditions remain constant for the duration of the spell, and stay with you when you move. The weather conditions in the spell's area cannot be changed by any means short of a control weather spell.

When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to its normal variability.
