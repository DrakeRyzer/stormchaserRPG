# Divination

## Evil Eye
*5th level Divination*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Special<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Special

When you cast this spell, one of your eyes goes blind. A creature that you look upon when you cast this spell is cursed by the evil eye. You can see what it sees through one of its eyes, but only see, not hear, feel, or hear thoughts. At the end of every day, the creature must roll 1d20. On a 1, the die size reduces by one step, e.g. from 1d20 to 1d12. When the die size is reduced to a 1d4 and the creatures rolls 1, the creature dies. Sight is returned to your blind eye when the creature dies.

## Legend Lore
*5th level Divination (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** See Text<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Incense worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1 week, cannot be cast as a ritual, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 1 month, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).

During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are "legendary", as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.
