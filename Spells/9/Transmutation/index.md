# Transmutation

## Time Stop
*9th-level transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous<br>
  
You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures.
  
**Action:** You take 3 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.

When you take this extra turn attack rolls are made with advantage and any attack that hits counts as a critical hit.
