**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

*You capture incoming energy, lessening its effect and storing it for an attack of your own.*

You gain resistance to elemental damage for the duration. If you took damage of these types within the last round, you recover half the stamina that you lost.

If you absorb damage using this spell, then the first time that you hit with a melee or ranged attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type and the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, for each point of mana above the 1st you gain an additional instance of resistance and the extra damage increases by 1d6.

When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have -1d on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/), [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/), or possessed by them. If the target is already [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/), [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/), or possessed by such a creature, the target has +1d on any new defence checks vs such an effect.

**Components:** V, S, M *(A small silver mirror.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

*Creatures think twice before attacking those with this spell's protection.*

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Charisma defence check vs your warding spell skill. On a failed check, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a [Fireball]().
