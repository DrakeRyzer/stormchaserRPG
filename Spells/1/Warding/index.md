When this spell is cast, you have resistance to the trigging damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time that you hit with a melee or ranged  attacks within the next round, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.

This spell triggers the first time you take acid, cold, electric, fire, or sonic damage, with the following exceptions: on your turn, or when you roll initiative, you may declare a specific trigger for this spell, or not to use it at all.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each point of mana above the 1st.

When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

While the spell is active, you can choose to spend this charge to deal an additional 2d10 energy damage when you hit with a weapon attack. Once you expend the charge the spell ends.

**Components:** V, S, M *(Holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

*You protect one against many types of creatures.*

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have -1d on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/), [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/), or possessed by them. If the target is already [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/), [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/), or possessed by such a creature, the target has +1d on any new defence checks against a relevant effect.

## Sanctuary
*1st Level Warding*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 30 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A small silver mirror.)*<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

*Creatures think twice before attacking those with this spell's protection.*

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Charisma defence check vs your warding spell skill. On a failed check, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a [Fireball]().

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.

*1st Level Warding*<br>
**Casting Time:** Trigger - You are hit by a melee or ranged attack.
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

*Before an attack impacts you, an invisible barrier of force appears to deflect the damage.*

Until the start of your next turn, you have a three-quarters cover and you take no damage from [Magic Missiles]().

If you go the entire round without being the target of a [Magic Missiles]() or your cover being hit, you reabsorb your magical shield and recover the mana spent to create it.

## Shield of Faith
*1st Level Warding*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 60 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it.)*<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

*A shimmering shield of divine energy appears to provide additional protection.*

A creature of your choice within range gains a +2 bonus to Strength and Dexterity defence vs melee and ranged attacks for the duration.

## Snare
*1st Level Warding (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** S, M *(25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

*You create an invisible snare that will hang any upside down who wander into it.*

As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle within a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful [Investigation](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Investigation/) check vs your warding spell skill to be perceived.

The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell’s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity defence check vs your warding spell skill or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) there until the spell ends.

A [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) creature can make a Dexterity defence check vs your warding spell skill at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an [Arcana](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Arcana/) check vs your warding spell skill. On a success, the [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) effect ends.

After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) by it.

## Traveler's Ward

**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Well-polished ball bearing.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

*A divine eye watches over your pockets.*

Until the spell ends, creatures have -1d on [Sleight of Hand](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/SleightofHand/) checks made against the target. If a creature fails a [Sleight of Hand](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/SleightofHand/) check to steal from the target, the ward creates a loud noise and a flash of bright light easily heard and seen by creatures within 100 feet.

## Ward the Evil Eye

**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Special

*Partially sacrificing your vision, you are guarded frpm magic by an malevolent force.* 

You must cover one eye in its entirety when you cast this spell. While the eye is covered, you have -1d on [Perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Perception/) checks that rely on sight and on melee and ranged attack rolls.

For the spell's duration, any hostile creature that attempts to target you with a spell must make a Charisma defence check. On a failure, the creature may not target you with the spell, but must instead target the creature nearest to you. This spell lasts until your eye is uncovered.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, both the temporary stamina and the cold damage increase by 5 for each point of mana above the 1st.
