**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*Tendrils of dark energy erupt from you and batter all creatures around you.*

Make a melee conjuration attack against each creature within range, other than yourself. On a hit, a target takes 2d6 decay damage and can’t take make attacks of opportunity or take other free actions until the start of its next turn. On a miss, the creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 2 or more mana, the damage increases by 1d6 for each point of mana above the 1st.

## Entangle
*1st Level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet (20-foot square)<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

*You cause grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground.*

Plants emerge from the ground and turn the area into difficult terrain for the duration.

When you cast the spell, make a conjuration attack vs the Strength defence of each creature within the area. On a hit, a creature is [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature [Restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) by the plants can use 2 actions to make a Strength defence check vs your conjuration spell skill. On a success, it frees itself.

When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

## Find Familiar
*1st Level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Hour<br>
**Range:** 10 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(10gp worth of charcoal, incense and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You summon a creature from another plane to assist you.*

You gain the service of a familiar that takes an animal form you choose, examples include: [bat](), [cat](), [crab](), [frog](), [hawk](), [lizard](), [octopus](), [owl](), [poisonous snake](), [rat](), [raven](), [sea horse](), [spider](), or [weasel](). Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

In combat, your familiar shares your same initiative count, but acts immediately after your turn. A familiar can't [Strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/), but it can take other actions as normal.

When the familiar drops to 0 Stamina, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. Using 1 Action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. Using 2 Actions while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Stamina or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.

While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, using 2 Actions, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are [Blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/) and [Deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/).

You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it cannot engage in other off-turn actions until its next turn when you cast a spell in this manner. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

## Floating Disc
*1st Level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A drop of mercury.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

*A disc of magical force materializes adjacent to you that is useful for carrying a heavy load.*

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disc remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disc falls to the ground.

The disc is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disc follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disc can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the disc (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 3 or more mana, the diameter increases by 3 feet and capacity increased by 500 pounds for every 2 mana above the 1st.

## Fog Cloud
*1st Level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet (20-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 hour

*A small area of fog appears, hiding everything within it.*

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each point of mana above the 1st.

## Ice Knife
*1st Level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet (5-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** S, M *(A drop of water or piece of ice.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You create a shard of ice, exploding when it reaches its target.*

Make a ranged conjuration attack against a target you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage.

Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. Make a conjuration attack vs the Dexterity defence of the target and each creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, a creature takes 2d6 cold damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each point of mana above the 1st.

## Oil Slick
*1st Level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet (10-foot square)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A drop of oil.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

*A pool of flammable oil covers the ground.*

You throw the flask of oil at a point within range and the oil spreads to cover a 10-foot square area. The area is difficult terrain for the duration. When the grease appears, make a cnjuration attack against each creature in the area vs its Dexterity defence. On a hit, a creature falls [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/). A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must make Dexterity defence check vs your conjuration spell skill. On a fail, it falls [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/).

The oil is flammable. Any 5 foot square of the oil exposed to fire ignites and burns away in 2 rounds. Each creature who enters the fire or starts it turn there takes 2d4 fire damage. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, you can increase the size of the square by 5 feet for each point of mana above the 1st.

## Unseen Servant
*1st Level Conjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** S, M *(A bit of string and wood.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

*You create an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command.*

The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

As an action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.
