# Conjuration

## Arms of Hadar
*1st Level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You invoke the power of Hadar, the Dark Hunger. Tendrils of dark energy erupt from you and batter all creatures within 10 feet of you. Make a melee spell attack roll against each creature in that area. On a hit, a target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and canâ€™t take make opportunity attacks or engage in other off-turn activity until its next turn. On a miss, the creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
