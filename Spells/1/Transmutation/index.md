# Transmutation

## Feather Fall
*1st Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Free Action<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, M *(A small feather or piece of down.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

When you or a creature within 60 feet of you fell within the last round, you may choose up to five fallen creatures within range. From the moment that the target fell, its rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.

## Lesser Darkvision
*1st Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You kneel down and meditate for one minute - adjusting to the darkness. After completing this meditation, your eyes have a slight glow and you are granted the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If exposed to direct sunlight, you must make a DC 10 concentration check in order to maintain the spell.
