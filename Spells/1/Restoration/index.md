## Bedrest
*1st Level Restoration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*Through calming words or healing touch, you help others recover from their fatigue from their adventures.*

A creature you touch recovers up to two levels of exhaustion on its next long rest, instead of the usual one. Additionally, this rest counts as 24 hours of bedrest for the purposes of healing injuries.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, the target recovers one additional level of exhaustion for each point of mana above the 1st.

## Heal
*1st Level Restoration (Ritual)*<br>
*Healing, Positive*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 to 3 Actions<br>
**Range:** Varies<br>
**Components:** Varies<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You channel positive energy to heal the living or damage the undead.*

If the target is a willing living creature, you roll one of its recovery die, add your spellcasting attribute modifier and heal that amount of Stamina. If the target is undead, then make a spellcasting attack vs its Constitution defence. On a hit, you deal the same amount of sacred damage to it.

This spell has no effect on constructs.

The number of actions that you spend when casting this spell determine its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, then the healing increases by one die for each point of mana above the 1st.

### One Action
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** S

### Two Actions
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S

### Three Actions
**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Your holy symbol)*

You disperse positive energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst. For each creature in the burst, roll the creature's recovery die and add your spellcasting attribute modifier to determine the amount of healing or damage.
