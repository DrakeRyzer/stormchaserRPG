# Enchantment

## Motivational Speech
*3rd level Enchantment*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** 60 ft<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

You address allies, staff, or innocent bystanders to exhort and inspire them to greatness, whether they have anything to get excited about or not. Choose up to five creatures within range that can hear you. For the duration, each affected creature gains 10 temporary hit points and attacks vs their Wisdom defence suffer disadvantage. If an affected creature takes damage, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes. One round after an affected creature loses the temporary hit points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the temporary hit points increase by 5 for each slot level above 3rd.

## Psychic Spy
*3rd Level Enchantment*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Special, see text.

With this spell, you can try to steal the elation from the mind of one humanoid you can see within 60 feet. Make a spell attack roll vs the target's Charisma defence. On a hit, you can steal one beneficial effect that they currently possess, such as an ongoing spell (as long as its level is equal to or less than the slot level that psychic spy was cast from), temporary hit points, or possession of Bardic Inspiration dice. The effect ends for the target and transfers to you for the remainder of its normal duration. If the effect requires concentration, you must concentrate on it instead of the original caster.
