# Conjuration

## Create Food and Water
Create Food and Water can be cast as a ritual.

## Set Loose the Crocodiles
*3rd level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A moat 20 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and with a radius 30 feet away from you is suddenly carved into the earth and filled with water. If these dimensions cannot be met, then the moat tears through any non-magical obstructions to form itself. Inside of the moat, countless crocodiles. Creatures who attempt to swim or leap across must make a Strength (Athletics) check or take 1d6 damage as they are pulled in. Creatures in the moat cannot move, and take 3d6 damage every turn until they succeed at the Strength (Athletics) check and can swim out. 

## Transfigure Dust into Vermin
*3rd level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Special<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Motes of dust are turned into lice, rats, and scorpions around you. Point to a creature. The vermin swarm them, biting and gnawing, dealing damage equal to your levels. At 6th level, this will be 6d6 damage, and at 7th, 7d6, and so on. This damage continues until the target brings fire to the vermin, or the spell is dispelled.
