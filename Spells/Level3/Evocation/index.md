# Evocation

## Gather Forth All the World's Waves
*3rd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

Lift your hands and sing to all the seas you cannot sea. A 30 foot radius of space around you is filled with churning, crashing waves of white-crested green water. Creatures in the water begin to drown, and thus can not speak or cast spells. On a hit, they are picked up and moved to random locations, taking a number of damage dice equal to your levels at the end of every round. Thus, at 6th level, they will take 6d6 damage, and at 7th, they will take 7d6 damage. After 1 round, the waves dissipate, returning to their distant homes.

## Sending
*3rd level Evocation (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Unlimited<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A short piece of fine copper wire.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognises you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.

## Spreading of the Repelling Minerals
*3rd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** 4 Rounds

Scatter minerals strange and esoteric as a part of this spell's casting. A 100 foot cube magical zone is created. Any and all metal objects are thrown out of it with haste, as are weapons made of stone or bone, over the next 4 rounds.
