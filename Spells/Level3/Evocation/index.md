# Evocation

## Gather Forth All the World's Waves
*3rd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

Lift your hands and sing to all the seas you cannot sea. A 30 foot radius of space around you is filled with churning, crashing waves of white-crested green water. Creatures in the water begin [suffocating](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/Suffocating/) and thus cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components, unless under an effect such as waterbreathing.

Make a spell attack roll vs the Strength defence of each creature in the area of the spell. On a hit, they take 3d8 bludgeoning damage and are picked up and deposited prone at a location of the spellcaster's choice within the area of the spell. On a miss, the creature takes half as much damage and remains unmoved. After 1 round, the waves dissipate, returning to their distant homes.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

## Sending
*3rd level Evocation (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Unlimited<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A short piece of fine copper wire.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognises you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.

## Spreading of the Repelling Minerals
*3rd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** 4 Rounds

Scatter minerals strange and esoteric as a part of this spell's casting. A 100 foot cube magical zone is created. Any and all metal objects are thrown out of it with haste, as are weapons made of stone or bone, over the next 4 rounds.
