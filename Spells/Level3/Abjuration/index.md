# Abjuration

## Counterspell
*3rd level Abjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Free Action<br>
**Range:** 60 feet<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, it makes a spellcasting attack roll modified by the spell's level vs your spellcasting ability defence modified by *counterspell*'s level. On a failure, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.

For example, if a level 5 wizard with 18 intelligence casts a 3rd level *counterspell* vs a 5th level *cone of cold* spell cast by a CR 6 Mage with 17 intelligence, the Mage makes a proficient roll with an attack bonus of:

<center>

**+3 Intelligence +5 *cone of cold* spell level = +8 attack bonus**

</center>

vs a DC of:

<center>

**10 +4 Intelligence +4 proficiency +3 *counterspell* level = DC 21**

</center>

*Counterspell* can only be cast when another creature that you can see casts a spell within 60 feet of you. In order to be ready to cast *counterspell*, you must on your own turn declare the conditions under which you will cast *counterspell*. If you wish to upcast *counterspell* then you must declare this in advance. You may only cast *counterspell* once per round.

The conditions must be specific. For example:
* I will *counterspell* the first spell that the mage casts.
* I will *counterspell* at 6th level the first evocation spell that the lich casts.
* I will *counterspell* the first spell attempting to heal the hobgoblin warlord.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the targeted spellcaster's defence is reduced as described above.

## Exorcise the Hated Evil
*3rd level Abjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Grab the throat of a barbarous or possessed creature and press a polished opal to its forehead. Pull the opal back, and all evil from the creature will exit it in the form of black, ichor-filled vomit. Afterwards, if the creature was barbarous or possessed, it is no more. Likewise, if the creature was cursed, it is cursed no more.
