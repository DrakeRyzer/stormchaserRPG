# Conjuration

## The Wall
*7th Level Conjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M (Another brick.)<br>
**Duration:** Until dispelled or torn down

A nonmagical wall of bricks and mortar springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of twenty 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-5-foot panels that are 16 inches thick, incorporating a 4-inch cavity. If a space would be surrounded below and on all four sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), the spell can create a pitched roof of tile and timber to create a fully enclosed volume. Roof sections do not count towards the total number of panels conjured by the spell.

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), make a conjuration spell attack roll vs their Dexterity defence. On a miss, it moves up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
    
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing structures or landforms. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm, create a ramp, or build a cantilevered annex onto an existing building.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can shape the wall to create battlements, windows, doorways and so on, though you cannot create details finer than the width of a brick (i.e. 3 inches).

The wall is an object made of brick that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has a Strength defence of 14 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness (not including cavities). Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.

Any creature that is surrounded on at least 4 sides by the wall is immune to being charmed or frightened and has resistance to psychic damage.
