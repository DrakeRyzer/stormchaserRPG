# Enchantment

## Anointed Skull's Midnight Whispers
*1st Level Enchantment (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self (10-Foot Radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(An undamaged human skull and droplets of holy water worth 2 gp, which the spell consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** Until Dawn

After anointing an undamaged human skull with droplets of holy water, hide it in a place where neither sun nor moon nor starlight will ever touch it. Upon casting this spell, the skull will begin to utter whispers that ooze from the spell's caster.

Make a spell attack roll vs the Wisdom defence of any hostile creature within 10 feet of you. On a hit, the creature is frightened by the whispers until they leave this 10 foot radius. Any creature that enters the radius on its turn must succeed at a Wisdom defence check or also become frightened of you.

The morning after this spell is cast, the skull is destroyed and the spell ends.

## Bare the Slave's Heart
*1st Level Enchantment (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(The preserved heart of a slave, worth 20 gp, which the spell consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** Special

Take the preserved heart of a slave and wrap it in hempen cord when you cast this spell. The next time that a creature touches this heart barehanded, make a spell attack roll vs the creature's Charisma defence. On a hit, the creature becomes a slave to the spell's caster until the heart is destroyed, or the magic dispelled. A slave will not do anything to harm itself or any friends it has, but will perform any manner of menial task for its master. An undead creature, or any creature immune to the charmed condition, is immune to this enchantment.

## Cause Fear
*1st Level Enchantment*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose one creature that you can see within range and call upon its dread of its worst nightmare. Make a spell attack roll vs the target's Wisdom defence. On a hit, the target becomes frightened of you until the spell ends. The frightened target can make a Charisma defence check at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
