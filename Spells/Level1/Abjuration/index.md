# Abjuration

## Absorb Elements
*1st Level Abjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Free Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

The spell captures some of the incoming energy from acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage that you took within the last round, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You recover half of the hit points that you have lost to damage of the chosen damage type since the end of your last turn. Also, the first time that you hit with a melee attack within the next round, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

## Bedrest
*1st Level Abjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature you touch recovers up to two levels of exhaustion on its next long rest, instead of the usual one. Additionally, this rest counts as 24 hours of bedrest for the purposes of healing injuries.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the target recovers one additional level of exhaustion for each slot level above 1st.

## But I Get Up Again
*1st Level Abjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A whiskey, a vodka, a lager and a cider worth a total of 2 sp, all of which the spellcaster consumes.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 hours

Casting this spell reminds you of the good times, preventing anyone or anything from keeping you down. You are immune to the prone condition for the duration, even if you lose consciousness.

## Mage Armour
*1st Level Abjuration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A strip of leather.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

You touch a willing creature and a magical protective force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target gains DR 4 and coverage 11-16. The effects of *mage armour* do not stack with worn armour. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action.

## Shield
*1st Level Abjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Free Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a three-quarters cover and you take no damage from *magic missile*.

If you go the entire round without being the target of a *magic missile* or your cover being hit, you reabsorb your magical shield and recover the spell point spent to create it.

## Ward the Evil Eye
*1st Level Abjuration*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Special

You must cover one eye in its entirety when you cast this spell. While the eye is covered, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on melee and ranged attack rolls.

For the spell's duration, any hostile creature that attempts to target you with a spell must make a Charisma defence check. On a failure, the creature may not target you with the spell, but must instead target the creature nearest to you. This spell lasts until your eye is uncovered.
