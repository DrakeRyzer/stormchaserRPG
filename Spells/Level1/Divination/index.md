# Divination

## Detect Evil
*1st Level Divination (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 60 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A divine focus.)*<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You can sense the presence of evil in a 60 foot cone in front of you. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

* **1st Round:** Presence or absence of evil.
* **2nd Round:** Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present.
* **3rd Round:** The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

If you are of good alignment and the strongest evil auraâ€™s power is overwhelming, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.

## Detect Evil and Good
*1st Level Divination (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

## Hunter's Mark
*1st Level Divination*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Free Action<br>
**Range:** 90 feet<br>
**Components:** None<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You choose a creature that you have seen within range in the last 6 seconds and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d4 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks that you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a free action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.

Hunter's Mark also allows the caster to sense the relative direction and distance of their marked target for the duration of the spell.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell at 2nd level, you deal 1d6 damage. When you cast this spell at 3rd level, you deal 1d8 damage and can concentrate for up to 8 hours. When you cast this spell at 4th level, you deal 1d10 and can concentrate for up to 8 hours. If you use a slot of 5th level or higher, you deal 1d12 damage and can concentrate for up to 24 hours.

## Lesser Foresight
*1st Level Divination (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A hummingbird feather.)*<br>
**Duration:** 8 Hours

You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armour. Until the spell ends, the target can sense melee and ranged attacks a split second before they happen. If the target is not already proficient in Dexterity defence, then it may add its proficiency bonus to its Dexterity defence. The spell ends if the target dons armour or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

## Tongue That Dream-Speaks
*1st Level Divination (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A bronze dagger worth 1 gp.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Split your tongue with a bronze dagger (suffering 1d4 slashing damage) and read aloud a text before you. You need not understand the text or know the language and you have 1 round in which to read it. When you are done, sleep. In your dreams you will understand all that you read and wake with a tongue healed. This spell allows you to understand even the ciphered text of other spellbooks.
