# Necromancy

## Gift Them Their Misfortune
*1st Level Necromancy*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Ointment of your own making.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

When you are missing hit points, suffer 1 damage as you smear the wound with bewitched ointments of your own make. Then make a melee attack roll to smear the blood-oil produced on another creature. On a hit, if the attack roll also beat the creature's Constitution defence, then the creature loses twice the hit points that you have lost.

## Nail to Them the Nomad's Curse
*1st Level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A list of wrongs committed by the target, which the spell consumes, and one nail.)*<br>
**Duration:** Special

Write upon a sheet of parchment the wrongs that a creature has committed, nail them to its home or lair and make a spell attack roll vs the creature's Wisdom defence. On a hit, for every wrong written, the creature will be unable to return to its home and unable to rest anywhere else.

Each day at dawn, one of the wrongs disappears. Creatures who are unable to rest due to this curse suffer one level of exhaustion at the dawn of every day and cannot rest to regain hit points. 

Each day at dusk, the creature may attempt a Charisma defence check to throw off the curse.
