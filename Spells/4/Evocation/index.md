# Evocation

## Flashbang
*4th level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

The next time that you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack during this spell's duration, a dazzling burst of radiant energy erupts on impact, releasing a concussive clap that is audible out to 300 feet. The attack deals an extra 2d6 sacred damage and 2d6 sonic damage to the target and disorients nearby creatures. Additionally, make an evocation attack roll vs the Constitution defence of the target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, a creature becomes [blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/) and [deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/) until the start of your next turn.

## Shimmering Light
*4th Level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 300 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M (A miniature replica of a mission bell.)<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

You shine a light towards a creature you can see within range, causing their head to grow heavy and their sight to grow dim, such that they might need to stop for the night. Make an evocation attack roll vs the target's Wisdom defence. On a hit, they are [blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/) for the duration and gain 1 level of [exhaustion](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Exhaustion/). The target can make a Wisdom defence check vs your evocation skill at the end of each of their turns, ending the blindness effect on a success.
