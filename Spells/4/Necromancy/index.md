# Necromancy

## Invisible Touch
*4th Level Necromancy*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

You create an invisible hand and use it to reach into a creature that you can see within 120 feet, taking hold of their heart and slowly tearing it apart. Make a ranged necromancy attack against the creature. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 profane damage and the hand continues to cling to their heart for the spell's duration.

As long as the hand clings to the target's heart, they cannot regain stamina and they take 2d8 profane damage at the start of each of their turns. The target can make a Charisma defence check vs your necromancy skill at the end of each of their turns, ending the spell on a success.

## Paint a Curse Upon the Tomb
*4th level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Cermonial paints.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

As a part of this spell, drench an object in the same paints used to adorn the tombs of god-kings and god-queens. Any creature that takes the object other than you is cursed. A cursed creature has a -1d to all attack rolls, defences and skill checks. If this results in a miss or failure for any reason, the creature suffers 1d6 profane damage. This curse persists until somehow dispelled, or if the cursed object is destroyed by fire.

## Ruin That Which Ruins Me
*4th level Necromancy*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Free Action, which you take when you die<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You can cast this spell only when you die. That which kills you dies for 1 round, resurrecting after that round with stamina equal to its recovery die multiplier.
