# Necromancy

## Invisible Touch
*4th Level Necromancy*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 120 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create an invisible hand and use it to reach into a creature you can see within 120 feet, taking hold of their heart and slowly tearing them apart. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage and the hand continues to cling to their heart for the spell's duration.

As long as the hand clings to the target's heart, they cannot regain hit points, and they take 2d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. The target can make a Charisma defence check against your spell skill DC at the end of each of their turns, ending the spell on a success.

## Paint a Curse Upon the Tomb
*4th level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

As a part of this spell, drench an object in the same paints used to adorn the tombs of god-kings and god-queens. Any creature that takes the object other than you is cursed. Said creature rolls twice on all die rolls and takes the worse result. If this would result in a failure for any reason, the creature suffers 1d6 damage. This curse persists until somehow dispelled, or if the cursed object is destroyed by fire.

## Resuscitate
*4th level Necromancy (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has died within the last hour. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival (its head, for instance) the spell automatically fails. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it return an undead creature to life.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a âˆ’2 penalty to all attack rolls, defences, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.<br>

## Ruin That Which Ruins Me
*4th level Necromancy*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Free Action, which you take when you die<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You can cast this spell only when you die. That which kills you dies for 1 round, resurrecting after that round with hit points equal to its total hit dice.
