# Divination

## From the Heaven's Eye, See Sin
*4th level Divination*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, until dusk

Stare into the sun when you cast this spell and do not look away until you wish it to end. While staring into the sun, you shall see anything that the sun could see, in any part of the word. You can see it as close as if you were currently 100 feet above ground. At night, this spell does naught, and it cannot be used in doors.

## Mold the Waxen Sacrifice
*4th level Divination (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Minute<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M<br>
**Duration:** Special

Present a waxen figure you have made as a part of casting this spell. Affix to the figure via nail a piece of another living creature. Whatever the figure feels so too will the living creature, though it will suffer no other ill effects from the figure's defacing. 10 times may the figure be manipulated before this spell ends.
