# Restoration

## Resuscitate
*4th level Restoration (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Diamonds worth 400 gp, which the spell consumes)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has died within the last hour. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival (its head, for instance) the spell automatically fails. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it return an undead creature to life.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a âˆ’2d dpenalty to all attack rolls, defences, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
