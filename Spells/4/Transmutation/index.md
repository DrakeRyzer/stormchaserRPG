# Transmutation

## Role Reversal
*4th Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M (A sugar pill.)<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

*The universal muse comes over you, inspiring you to break it all down.*

Choose two willing humanoids that you can see within range. The targets exchange one talent (other than spellcasting) with each other, losing their ability but gaining access to the other party's talent for the duration. For example, you could choose barbarian and bard talents, granting the Bardic Inspiration feature to the barbarian and Rage to the bard. A creature cannot gain an ability that it already has through this spell, and abilities that have limited uses are not recharged at any point: the creature gaining the ability inherits however many uses were remaining at the time the spell was cast, and the original owner of the ability is left with only as many uses as were unspent at the end of the spell's duration.
