# Transmutation

## Role Reversal
*4th Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M (A sugar pill.)<br>
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

When you cast this spell, the universal muse comes over you, inspiring you to break it all down. Choose two willing humanoids with class levels that you can see within range. The targets exchange one class feature (other than spellcasting) with each other, losing their ability but gaining access to the other party's ability for the duration. For example, you could choose a barbarian and a bard, granting the Bardic Inspiration feature to the barbarian and Rage to the bard. A creature cannot gain an ability it already has through this spell, and abilities that have limited uses are not recharged at any point: the creature gaining the ability inherits however many uses were remaining at the time the spell was cast, and the original owner of the ability is left with only as many uses as were unspent at the end of the spell's duration.
