# Transmutation

## Elemental Body
*rth Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(The element you plan to assume.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 minute

You magically assume the shape of a elemental - air, earth, fire or water. When the duration ends, you revert to your normal form, unless you expend further mana. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using 1 action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 stamina, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply all forms that you take:<br>
* You retain all of your attribute scores and walking speed, though they can be modified as shown below depending on the chosen form. You also retain all your skill and defence proficiencies.
* You can speak as normal while in this form, though the sound of your voice may be altered by the elemental you have chosen.
* You can cast spells if they contain only a verbal component. Transforming doesn’t prevent you from sustaining a spell that you’ve already cast, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you’ve already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your talents, species, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as low-light vision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* Your gear is absorbed into your new form. Any persistent magical bonus granted by the gear still applies, however you cannot use any feature of your gear that requires you to activate it.

## Role Reversal
*4th Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M (A sugar pill.)<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

*The universal muse comes over you, inspiring you to break it all down.*

Choose two willing humanoids that you can see within range. The targets exchange one talent (other than spellcasting) with each other, losing their ability but gaining access to the other party's talent for the duration. For example, you could choose barbarian and bard talents, granting the Bardic Inspiration feature to the barbarian and Rage to the bard. A creature cannot gain an ability that it already has through this spell, and abilities that have limited uses are not recharged at any point: the creature gaining the ability inherits however many uses were remaining at the time the spell was cast, and the original owner of the ability is left with only as many uses as were unspent at the end of the spell's duration.
