# Samurai 
The Samurai are the militaristic retainers of noble clans who are sent to lead armies as officers or keep the peace between the people. They themselves are often part of the nobility too, holding high prestige, land of their own, and having special privileges not given to any other social class. 

### Bushidō
Although not all Samurai follow similar values, many are taught basic, but difficult, ways to conduct themselves as a warrior and noble. These shared values have often been refered to as "The Eight Virtues of Bushidō"

- *Courage (勇 yū):* Decipher what is right and wrong and have the strength to act upon it.
- *Compassion (慈悲 jihi):* Manifest love and sympathy through patience and ensure you see the world from the perspective of another.
- *Respect (礼 rei):* To collaborate with another person, politeness must be employed, keeping in mind their own experiences and feelings.  
- *Integrity (誠 makoto):* Live with honestly and sincerity. 
- *Honour (名誉 meiyo):* Uphold your sense of self worth and live by the highest code of conduct acknowledging your moral responsibilities.
- *Loyalty (忠義 chūgi):* Stay true to yourself and when fealty is given, this must not be abandoned even under difficult circumstances.
