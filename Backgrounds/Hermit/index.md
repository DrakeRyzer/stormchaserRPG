# Hermit
You lived in seclusion (either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone) for a formative part of your life. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for.

## Equipment
A scroll case stuffed full of notes from your studies or prayers, a winter blanket, a set of common clothes, a herbalism kit and 5 gp.

## Life of Seclusion
What was the reason for your isolation, and what changed to allow you to end your solitude? You can work with your GM to determine the exact nature of your seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below to determine the reason behind your seclusion.

|:--:|:------------------|
| 1 | I was searching for spiritual enlightenment. |
| 2 | I was partaking of communal living in accordance with the dictates of a religious order. |
| 3 | I was exiled for a crime I didn't commit. |
| 4 | I retreated from society after a life-altering event. |
| 5 | I needed a quiet place to work on my art, literature, music, or manifesto. |
| 6 | I needed to commune with nature, far from civilisation. |
| 7 | I was the caretaker of an ancient ruin or relic. |
| 8 | I was a pilgrim in search of a person, place, or relic of spiritual significance. |

## Feature: Discovery
The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.

Work with your GM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.

## Other Hermits
This hermit background assumes a contemplative sort of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of other people, look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte might be what you're looking for. Or you could even be a charlatan, posing as a wise and holy person and letting pious fools support you.
