# Backgrounds
Characters are defined by much more than their species and class. They're individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This section expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

## Benefits
Each background provides a character with:
* 2x +1 (stackable) to mental attributes that you consider your character to have developed as a result of this background.
* An occupational feature, which is a unique benefit based on your character's occupation.
* A package of starting equipment that your character possesses from their previous occupation.
* 10 character points to spend on background talents, skills, tools or languages, as described below.

A background talent may be a species talent, a skill talent, a tool talent, or other talent marked ᴮᴳ. If you use [the optional rule to spend coin on gear](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/StartingEquipment/), you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

## Languages
Your culture indicates the languages that your character can speak by default and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Common Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign.
* Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.
* Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
* The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.
* The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.
* Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples that they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.
* Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script.

With your GM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.
* Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.
