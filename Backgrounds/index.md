# Backgrounds
Characters are defined by much more than their species and class. They're individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This section expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

## Benefits
Each background provides a character with:
* +2 to single mental attribute that you consider your character to have developed as a result of this background.
* A background feature, which is a unique benefit based on your character's background.
* A package of starting equipment that your character possesses from their previous occupation.
* 10 character points to spend on background talents, skills, tools or languages, as described below.

A background talent may be a species talent, a skill talent, a tool talent, or other talent marked ᴮᴳ. If you use [the optional rule to spend coin on gear](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/StartingEquipment/), you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.
