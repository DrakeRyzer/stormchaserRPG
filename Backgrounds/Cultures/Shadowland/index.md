# Shadowland
Whereas most cultures focus on light and the immanence of life, the shadowlanders contemplate the nature of death and destruction, drawing inspiration and comfort from the darkness. Although other cultures often consider them heretical, shadowlanders are creatures of twilight and it is only natural that some turn towards the day and others towards the night. The traditional shadowlander religion is to worship deities of the moon, although there are also animistic traditions which venerate creatures favored by assassins (such as scorpions, snakes, spiders, and even the undead). Shadowlanders do not view the darkness as being inherently evil. Although they recognise that the most vile monsters do prefer the darkness, For shadowlanders, it provides forms of freedom and wisdom that are unavailable in the oppressive light.

Shadowlanders tend to live in places that normally strike fear into the hearts of other mortals such as deserts, scorched lands near a volcano, haunted territories, notorious slums and underground caverns. This is partially intentional, because these places are ideal for contemplating destruction, but the “choice” is also often the result of ostracisation and banishment by would-be neighbours.

Of all cultures, shadowlanders are the most likely to offer their services to other peoples. They and people trained in their ways make some of the most cunning assassins, advisors, mercenaries. and spies. Having such a person in one’s entourage is often a mark of pride among the rich and famous.
