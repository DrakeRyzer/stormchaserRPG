# Shadowland
Whereas most cultures focus on light and the immanence of life, the shadowlanders contemplate the nature of death and destruction, drawing inspiration and comfort from the darkness. Although other cultures often consider them heretical, shadowlanders are creatures of twilight and it is only natural that some turn towards the day and others towards the night. The traditional shadowlander religion is to worship deities of the moon, although there are also animistic traditions which venerate creatures favored by assassins (such as scorpions, snakes, spiders, and even the undead). Shadowlanders do not view the darkness as being inherently evil. Although they recognise that the most vile monsters do prefer the darkness, For shadowlanders, it provides forms of freedom and wisdom that are unavailable in the oppressive light.

Shadowlanders tend to live in places that normally strike fear into the hearts of other mortals such as deserts, scorched lands near a volcano, haunted territories, notorious slums and underground caverns. This is partially intentional, because these places are ideal for contemplating destruction, but the “choice” is also often the result of ostracisation and banishment by would-be neighbours.

Of all cultures, shadowlanders are the most likely to offer their services to other peoples. They and people trained in their ways make some of the most cunning assassins, advisors, mercenaries. and spies. Having such a person in one’s entourage is often a mark of pride among the rich and famous.

Characters raised in the shadowland culture share a variety of features in common with one another.

## Alignment
Shadowlanders have a strong sense of racial superiority and divide outsiders into two groups: slaves and those who are not yet slaves. However, in practice, species that may share similar inclinations (such as hobgoblins and orcs) and those who serve willingly may be treated as servitor races and granted a measure of trust and modest rank in shadowlander society. Others (such as dwarves, gnomes and halflings) are deemed fit only for the lash. Manipulative shadowlanders delight in exploiting the weak character of humans. While they claim no kinship with fetchlings, the shadowlanders harbour a curiosity towards the shadow race, as both are adaptations of races exposed to extreme and dangerous conditions. Finally, the shadowlanders’ hatred of forest elves sets these beings apart from all other races and shadowlander elves desire nothing more than to ruin everything about their cousins.
