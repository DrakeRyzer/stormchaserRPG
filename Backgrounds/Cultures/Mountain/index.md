# Mountain Hall
When most people think of mountain halls, they think of dwarves. Living in tall mountains, or vast hills, allows them easier access to useful minerals and superior defenses. The abundance of ore leads many dwellers of the mountain halls to become smiths and exporting these goods is frequently the cornerstone of a thriving mountain hall economy.

Mountain hall communities are very traditional, as well as detailed and demanding in the keeping of historical records. It is said that "the sky will fall before a dwarf forgets a slight" and, while these grudges can be kept for generations, the same is true of favours. If you help a dwarf of a mountain hall, you might not live to see the debt repaid, but your descendants surely will.

In a mountain hall community, everybody receives at least basic combat training. This allows the smiths to see their work put to use and to personally understand the importance of quality weapons and sturdy armour. You can trust an armoursmith whose life depends on their work.

Characters raised in the mountain hall culture share a variety of features in common with one another.

## Alignment
Most who hail from a mountain hall are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.

You benefit from +1d on [Perception](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Specific/Perception/) checks to notice unusual stonework. This bonus applies to checks to discover mechanical traps made of stone or hidden within stone.
