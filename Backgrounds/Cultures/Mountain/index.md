# Mountain Dwarf
When most people think of dwarves, they think of mountain dwarves. Living in tall mountains or vast hills allows them easier access to useful minerals and superior defenses. The abundance of ore leads many mountain dwarves to become smiths, especially weaponsmiths and armoursmiths. Exporting these goods is frequently the cornerstone of a thriving mountain dwarf economy. Indeed, there are many stout folk that trace their lineage to fallen dwarven kingdoms of old, dreaming of restoring lost glory even if the present is already affluent enough.

Mountain dwarves are very traditional, as well as detailed and demanding in the keeping of historical records. There is a saying: "the sky will fall before a dwarf forgets a slight". While these grudges can be kept for generations, the same is true of favours. If you help a mountain dwarf, you might not live to see the debt repaid, but your descendants surely will.

Having good weapons and armour is no use if you cannot utilise them. Mountain dwarves are all trained in combat, which allows them to see their work put to use and to personally understand the importance of quality weapons and sturdy armour. You can trust an armoursmith whose life depends on their work.

Characters raised in the mountain dwarf culture share a variety of features in common with one another.

## Alignment
Most mountain dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.
