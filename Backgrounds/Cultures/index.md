# Cultures
The first step in the background creation process is choosing your character’s culture. This is the culture that they were raised in, or that of their parents, and does not need to be related to their species. A character’s culture can be used to represent their past as a refugee, adoption into a new family, or being raised outside of their own people for any other reason. The culture that you choose provides your character with a number of proficiencies and traits that they would have learned through living amongst that culture, or that members of that culture are often trained in.

For each species, there are a handful of suggested cultural options. When building your character, you can choose only one culture to gain traits from. Each culture listed here includes a description of what sort of life a character from that culture would experience. This description can range from the morals and traditions instilled in them to how they found themselves a part of that culture to begin with. The following sections appear in the description for most cultures.

## Alignment
Most cultures have tendencies toward certain alignments, as described here. These are not binding for player characters. However, for example, considering why your mountain dwarf is chaotic in defiance of lawful mountain dwarf society can help you to better define your character.

## Cultural Features
Each culture contains a range of features. You gain all of the traits associated with your chosen culture, unless the text says otherwise.

## Languages
This section details the languages that a character can read, speak, write, and sign, provided there is no disability or condition that prevents them from doing so. When given a choice of language, consider choosing one that further brings your character to life. This decision could be impacted by family, previous occupations, or even a special interest.
