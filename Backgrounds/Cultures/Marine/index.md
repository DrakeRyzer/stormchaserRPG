# Marine Realm
Characters raised in the marine realm culture share a variety of features in common with one another.

## Alignment
Forest guardians love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

## Features

#### Friend of the Sea
Using gestures and sounds, you can communicate simple ideas with any beast that has an innate swimming speed.

### Weapon Training
You are trained with simple polearms, simple flexible weapons and simple crossbows. Additionally, treat any weapon with the word “elven” in its name or properties as a martial weapon.

If your class grants training with simple polearms, or simple flexible weapons, you gain training in martial polearms, or martial flexible weapons, respectively. If your class grants training with martial polearms, martial flexible weapons, or simple crossbowss, you gain 2 proficiency point. If your class grants proficiency in two of the above, you gain 4 proficiency points. If your class grants proficiency in all three of the above, you gain 6 proficiency points.

## Languages
You can speak, read and write Elvish, Aquan and one other language.

Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
