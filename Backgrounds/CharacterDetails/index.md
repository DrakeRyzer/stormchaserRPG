# Character Details
Your character's name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.

## Name
Your character’s species description includes sample names for members of that species. Put some thought into your name even if you're just picking one from a list.

## Sex
You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a male dark elf cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of dark elf society, which could be a reason for your character to leave that society.

You don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s image. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide.

## Height and Weight
You can decide your character’s height and weight, using the information provided in your species description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character’s ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.

If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character’s height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character’s extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character’s extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.

## Other Physical Characteristics
You choose your character’s age and the colour of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.

### Age
Advanced age can bring with it modifiers to attribute scores. Age brackets vary with species. These effects are described individually and are not cumulative. Dwarves move Charisma to the set of attributes receiving penalties with age and Constitution to those receiving bonuses.

| Age Bracket | Effects |
|:-----------:|:-------:|
|  Middle Age  | -1 to Str, Dex or Con. +1 to Int, Wis or Cha. |
|  Elderly  | -1 to two of Str, Dex and Con. +1 to two of Int, Wis and Cha. Movement speed is reduced by 5 ft. |
|  Venerable  | -1 to Str, Dex and Con. +1 to Int, Wis and Cha. Movement speed is reduced by 5 ft. |

## Alignment
A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins and most dwarves are lawful good.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants and most gnomes are neutral good.

**Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves and unicorns are chaotic good.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids and many humans are neutral.

**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues and some bards, are chaotic neutral.

**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons and hobgoblins are lawful evil.

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many dark elves, some cloud giants and goblins are neutral evil.

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons and orcs are chaotic evil.

### Alignment in the Multiverse
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves and other humanoid species can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos.

Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, or tend towards lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceases to be lawful evil, it changes into something new, a transformation worthy of legend.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments. They are **unaligned**. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.

## Languages
Your species indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Common Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your GM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.

## Personal Characteristics
Your character’s personality is comprised of an array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity. Fleshing it out will help you bring them to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.

Each background presented includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You're not bound to those options, but they're a good starting point.

### Personality Traits
Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every book in Candlekeep” tells you something specific about your character’s interests and disposition.

Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.

### Ideals
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?

You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.

### Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.

### Flaws
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness. In particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?
