# Wisdom
Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

## Wisdom Checks
A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someoneâ€™s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
* Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
* Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

## Spellcasting Ability
Disciples and mages can use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the attack bonus for spells that they cast.
