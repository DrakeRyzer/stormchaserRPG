# Dexterity
Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

## Dexterity Checks
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The athletics, sleight of hand, and stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
* Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
* Steer a chariot around a tight turn
* Pick a lock
* Disable a trap
* Securely tie up a prisoner
* Wriggle free of bonds
* Play a stringed instrument
* Craft a small or detailed object

## Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

## Initiative
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat, as described in [Initiative](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/TheOrderofCombat/Initiative/).
