# Defences
Your defences represent your ability to resist spells, traps, poison, disease and similar threats to avoid taking damage and overcome attacks to the body and mind. If an opponent's attack roll equals or exceeds your defence score, the attack hits.

You have six defence scores and each class grants training in three defences. For example, the warrior is trained in two physical defences and one mental defence. Training in a defence lets a character add their training bonus to that defence score. Most monsters also have one or more trained defence.

If a defence check is called for, make an ability check using the named attribute. If you are trained in the defence, then you roll with +1d as usual.

If a defence check is made to avoid being hit by an attack that would have had +1d, then that defence check is made with -1d. This counts as the attack having +1d for the purposes of triggering abilities such as a sneak attack from the rogue talent tree. If a defence check is made to avoid being hit by an attack that would have had -1d, then the defence check is made with +1d.

## Strength Defence

<center><strong>10 + Strength modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties</strong></center>

A character's Strength defence represents their physical power. How well can they oppose a force that would physically move or bind them?

When defending in melee you can choose to use your Strength defence to block an attack, rather than evading it. You take -1d to your Strength defence vs melee attacks that deal bludgeoning damage and +1d to your Strength defence vs melee attacks that deal slashing damage.

> ### Blocking With An Item
> A weapon or shield can be pushed beyond its limits, damaging it in the process. When you make a Strength defence check to block an attack, you may choose to brace your weapon or shield against the threat. The item takes the damage that the attack would deal to you (see [Interacting With Objects](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/InteractingWithObjects/)) and you benefit from advantage on the Strength defence check.

## Dexterity Defence

<center><strong>10 + Dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties</strong></center>

A character's Dexterity defence represents their physical finesse. How well can they dodge out of harm's way?

In combat, most attacks target a creature's Dexterity Defence. You take +1d to your Dexterity defence vs melee attacks that deal bludgeoning damage and -1d to your Dexterity defence vs melee attacks that deal slashing damage.

## Constitution Defence

## Intelligence Defence

<center><strong>10 + Intelligence modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties</strong></center>

A character's Intelligence defence represents their mental finesse. How well can they disbelieve certain illusions and refute mental assaults with logic, sharp memory, or both?

## Wisdom Defence

<center><strong>10 + Wisdom modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties</strong></center>

## Charisma Defence

<center><strong>10 + Charisma modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties</strong></center>

A character's Charisma defence represents their mental power. How well can they withstand effects, such as possession, that would subsume their personality or hurl them to another plane of existence?
