# Wisdom Subskills

## Animal Handling Subskills

### Entomology
Favoured by the dark elves, your knowledge of insects and arachnids allows you to identify the small ones and convince the big ones to let you ride them.

### Falconry
Working with majestic birds, you can train them to send messages to other cities, find food, or if your sizes allow, ride them.

### Horsemanship
Many an adventurer has swung a sword from horseback, but these creatures need to be trained to wade into battle. Understanding your mount will go a long way towards keeping it from flinging you off.

### Kenneling
While others know how to deal with animals and even ride them, learning kenneling will allow you to keep and breed them. Many lords will have large kennels of canines with which to hunt.

### Shepherding
While not as glamourous as a giant spider, eagle, wolf or horse, the shepherd deals with herding groups of animals. A rider can calm a horse, but a shepherd can calm a whole herd of cows, sheep or goats.

## Insight Subskills

### Combat Sense
Everyone knows to take the high ground, but there are hundreds of battlefield strategies that can keep adventurers alive. Likewise, understanding that your opponent also knows these tricks is an equally useful tool.

### Empathy
A bard might understand how to make others see their point of view with a silvered tongue. Empathy will let you understand how someone else is feeling without having to press them as forcibly. A more subtle art, certainly. 

## Medicine Subskills

### Apothecary
Ointments, medicines and unguents are all different ways of solving what ails the common man who can't afford to down a healing potion whenever they get a headache. Being trained in the skill allows you to separate real cures from snake oil.

### Forensics
Looking at a battlefield and being able to determine which side won, where the victors went and who might have survived takes as sharp a wit as being able to look at a corpse and determine the cause of death. Such a skill can help keep the same fate from befalling the players.

### Massage Therapy
Physical therapy is not only a useful skill medicinally, but many a powerful ruler has had their ear swayed when they were in good moods during a skilled massage. 

### Veterinary
While many medicines apply in a general way between humans and horses, understanding the specific differences between the two can help you apply medicine to animals. 

## Perception Subskills

### Eavesdropping
Listening through a door, from a distance, or around a corner is not an easy task. Another one of those skills that urban adventurers find useful.

### Guarding
You have an ever-watchful eye that can spot movement or any other irregularities around you. You keep a perfect watch, able to tell friend from foe and patiently guard your surroundings. 

### Tasting
Wow, you can really taste the poison! Every lord, king, or emperor will be glad they have royal tasters specially trained in picking out the dangers lurking within their food.

## Survival Subskills

### Find Water
It's recommended players take time to drink a few times in an adventuring day. In some of the more dangerous regions of the world that can be hard to do. Being trained to find water can help mitigate this risk.

### Fire Mastery
Something even children are taught and one of the basics of survival, you know how to start, stop, or enlarge a fire. Also, you can easily determine how long a fire has been burning.

### Fishing
Let others eat berries. Find yourself some of that delicious flaky food. A staple in any port location, many adventurers will supplement their dried foods with fish.

### Foraging
No water nearby? Can't hunt because the animals in the forest belong to the king and his evil henchmen? If you're going to end up eating berries, it's a good idea to know the difference between the ones that will make you feel better and the ones that will leave you sick.

### Region Navigation
Can't see the forest for the trees? Finding the Underdark keeps twisting around in circles? An ocean all around you and no idea where you are? Take some time to learn how to navigate the world and never feel lost again. When picking this skill, select a region from the Regional Lore expertise. You can take this skill multiple times, selecting a new region each time.

### Rope Mastery
You might not want to kill your foes, but they certainly can't be allowed to walk around freely. Why not tie them up with a rope? Or tie off a rope as an impromptu ladder for those times you're in the dungeon and a ladder cannot be found.

### Skinning
Animals need to be skinned before becoming the leather armour that ends up protecting your more lightly armoured friends and warming more northern peoples.  It is recommended for GMs to set the DC based on how difficult removal is and to reward failures with lower yields.

### Tracking
Not everyone can be so lucky as to track foes through wet mud or snow. Being skilled in spotting the tell-tale signs of your prey through the best and worst of conditions is useful to most adventuring groups.

### Trapping
If the whole 'slowly chase animals and shoot them with arrows' thing isn't working for you, try luring them with some bait into a trap! It is advised that the GM sets the DC based on how plentiful creatures are in the area.

### Weather Sense
Storm's a brewin' and you can tell! Know what the weather will be like in a few hours or even a few days, if you're really good at it.
