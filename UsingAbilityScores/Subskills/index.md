# Subskills
This section lets you add depth and customisation to skills in a meaningful way related to your character's background and training. Subskills are narrow domains of knowledge and mastery that further refine skills. You can develop subskills only in skills that you are proficient in. 

Subskills grant one additional die of advantage on ability checks to which the subskill is relevant.

You can learn a subskill by spending a character point to do so, or by spending time [training](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/BetweenAdventures/DowntimeActivities/#training).
