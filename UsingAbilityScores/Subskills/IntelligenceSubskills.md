# Intelligence Subskills

## Arcana Subskills

### Aberration Lore
Aberrations are the strange and unusual creatures of the far realms. Experts can spend decades learning about these creatures but often end up going insane from picking up forbidden knowledge.

### Arcane Spell Lore
A wizard pulls out a pinch of sulfur and bat guano. Woe to the hero who doesn't identify a fireball spell before experiencing it firsthand.

### Construct Lore
Wizards are often considered fragile or frail, their strength in the arcane leads them to have powerful bodyguards made of stone, iron, or flesh. These constructed guardians will fight to the death for their masters.

### Elemental Lore
Airy assassins, powerful efreeti, and alien gem-eating mounds of rock, the elemental planes spit out all manner of unusual creature. But their long history and ties to the creation of existence make them a well studied group.

### Monstrosity Lore
While natural creatures like wolves and bears are well known to all, there are rarer beings like hydras and centaurs that inhabit the lands. With unusual abilities like turning players to stone from a paralyzing gaze or dissolving metals with only a touch, it's the wise hero who knows about these beasts. 

> #### Monster Lore
>
> You can use Arcana, History, Nature and Religion to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities.
>
> In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster’s CR. For common monsters, such as goblins, the DC of this check equals 5 + the monster’s CR. For particularly rare monsters, such as the tarrasque, the DC of this check equals 15 + the monster’s CR or more. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.

## History Subskills

### Ancient Lore
Is that statue historically relevant to the people who made the dungeon you're in, or is it something that was added in a later age? Knowing who built things and why can give greater insight into how they can help you now.

### Appraising
Knowing the cut of a gem, the difficulty in casting a bronze statue, or the elegance of a wooden box, allows you to understand exactly how ripped off you're going to get from the merchants in town.

### Bureaucracy
A hero gains understanding of the ins and outs of governments, politics, and those who pull the strings behind the scenes. Players who train in bureaucracy long for the safety of dungeons. 

### Dragon Lore
Everyone thinks they know all about dragons, but the creatures are so prolific and create so many half-breeds that filtering fact from fiction is difficult. A smart hero would want to study them.

### Giant Lore
Uncertain which giant sitting in a circle is the leader? Can't tell a Storm and a Cloud giant apart? Perhaps picking up the Giant Lore skill would help your hero avoid these confusions. 

### Heraldry
You see a shield emblazoned *Party per pale or and vert, a dragon segreant sable*. Does it belong to the evil baron from the next county or the benevolent king in your debt? Knowing means the difference between being celebrated or captured.

### Humanoid Lore
Humans, Elves, Dwarves and the other races of the world have raised empires, toppled kingdoms, forged alliances, and broken them with each other.

### Law
Knowledge of the rules and regulations, and the consequences that will happen when your party members break them.

### Regional Lore
How old is Camwen? What are the laws regarding open magic in Beschcadik? Who is the consulate from Eldren in Khazak Akhor? Only a fool would go into a country without knowing anything about it.

When picking this skill, select a region from the campaign setting. You can take this skill multiple times, selecting one new region each time. Generally, if the world has only a few regions, each one would get an appropriate skill. If you have a great many regions, try grouping them. For example, in Arden the Sarameian Empire exists. The Empire includes the provinces of Saramei, Tanem, Rajan, and Xingong.

## Investigation Subskills

### Cryptography
Cryptography is used when someone wants to hide information inside something else. Players can pick up the hidden meaning in a story, a password drawn into a painting, or a message left for a member of a hidden society. 

### Deduction
The ability to see connections between seemingly random facts, and the process of reaching a decision or answer by evaluating known facts.

### Information Gathering
Walking around town, picking up rumors, is a common adventurer past time. Plying locals with booze to get secrets out of them is a great cover for getting drunk in town.

## Nature Subskills

### Beast Lore
Lions, Tigers and Bears. And Giant Rats. And Dinosaurs. Prepared players are ready for all of these horrors nature decided to throw at them.

### Botany
If it's not walking, talking and thinking but it's still a plant, those trained in botany know all about it. Farmers, cooks, rangers, and scholars tend to fill out their ranks.

### Cartography
There's a big difference between being able to read the lay of the land in person, and reading a map. Knowing how to create and read maps is especially important for adventurers wanting to explore new lands.

### Fey Lore
The Seelie and Unseelie courts are something no rational character will want to delve into, but rarely do you interact with these strange beings of your own volition.

### Geography
Knowing how and why mountains form, what rocks lay under the ocean and which side of trees moss tends to are all skills useful to those who trek through the wilds. You can read the lay of the land faster than any map.

### Geology
No dwarf worth their salt would be caught dead not knowing the differences between rock types. If you plan on delving through caves or even the Underdark, it's advised you listen to their knowledge.

### Ooze Lore
One would think that Oozes don't have much lore behind them but the Oozeologists of the worlds disagree. These creatures have a tendency to inhabit exactly the places which players need to go.

### Plant Lore
While farmers grow wheat and rotting wood grows new mushrooms, there are more mobile threats to the world. 

### Poison
Is a substance safe to touch? To breathe? To apply to your weapon? Not all poisons are created equal and their dangerous nature means understanding them makes you much safer.

## Religion Subskills

### Celestial Lore
Angels are powerful creatures and it's an old hero's adage: don't anger anyone who can vaporize you in a beam of concentrated holy light.

### Ceremony
Watching a priest perform a ritual in the center of town is something most wouldn't consider unusual. Those keen of eye and armed with the knowledge of the hidden rituals of Tamoachan would know something evil is afoot.

### Divine Spell Lore
A priest raises their hands, calling out for a powerful being to lend them power. With your hefty knowledge of divine spells, you'll know if they're summoning a fiendish weasel or casting a magical darkness.

### Fiend Lore
Devils? Demons? It's inadvised to trust either, but knowing which one sticks to their word and which doesn't will save your life.

### Prophecy Lore
Players deal with prophecies regularly, but it usually involves seeking out wise old mountain dwellers for their knowledge. Cut out the middle prophet by learning about them yourself.

### Undead Lore
A skeleton stands before you, a few strands of hair clinging to the dome of its skull. A quick check will tell you if you should rush a disposable guardian or if you're about to be disintegrated by a powerful lich.

### Zeal
A priest needs to communicate with the followers of their God. Zeal allows them to pass religious messages along with their sermons, similar to Bards using the Perform skill with an audience.
