# Strength Subskills

## Athletics Subskills

### Climbing
Scaling cliffsides or reaching rooftops, few players have lasting careers without the use of climbing out of trouble.

### Jumping
Jumping allows players to leap in great bounds horizontally, or try to attain great heights vertically.

### Mining
Extracting minerals and metals from the ground is a staple in worlds where iron and steel see kingdoms rise and fall. This is a new use of the Athletics skill. GMs should set DCs based on how long or difficult it would take to extract valuables. Failure results in half yields.

### Swimming
Crossing rapid streams, delving into the lair of a black dragon, or communing with mermaids, few are the players who stay dry forever.
