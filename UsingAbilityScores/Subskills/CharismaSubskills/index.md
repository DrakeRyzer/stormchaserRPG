# Charisma Subskills

## Deception Subskills

### Acting
From impressing audiences in amphitheaters of large cites to tricking mob bosses in sewer lairs, the skill of Acting can be plied widely across the land.

### Boasting
Drunks from taverns across the world, trained or otherwise, flood the ears of passers by with the Boasting skill. Of course, every single boasted tale is absolutely factual as well! 

### Disguise
This is the ability to apply pigments, makeup, and prosthetics to literally make someone look unlike themselves. The GM should set the DC according to how difficult it would be to make the target look like something else.

### Fast-talk
Your lips are just as quick as your wits, and combining both throws people off of the intent of your words and directly where you want them (provided they don't notice your duplicity).

### Mimicry
Calling out to a goblin tribe, mimicking their war boss, and having them let prisoners loose is a great test of your Mimicry skill. Of course, sounding like someone isn't enough to convince people you are them but it's a start.

## Intimidation Subskills

### Savagery
Talking to barbarians, tribal creatures, and other so-called 'uncivilized' societies requires a different set of skills from playing around in a court. The Savagery skill is used in the same way that Etiquette is used in civilized places or Zeal in locations of faith.

### Interrogation
Extracting information from a source, sometimes by force. The GM should use a character's passive Constitution (Athletics (Pain Tolerance)) score to set the DC for using this skill.

## Performance Subskills

### Comedy
What's the deal with Orcs subjugating other races? Comedy is a great way to endear yourself to your audience. Of course the wrong joke to the right crowd could end very poorly. 

### Dancing
Dancing is a universal sign of civilization. From the smallest Halflings to the largest Giants, every race seems to have their own culturally significant way to cut a rug.

### Entertainment Mastery
You have mastered a form of entertainment appropriate to specific situations. When picking this subskill, select a style. You can take this subskill multiple times, selecting one new style each time. You can use this subskill to perform in a way that is particularly fitting to specific situation. If you use an instrument you are proficient with, you gain advantage to your skill check. 

* **Tavern Music** - jolly or rautious songs of simple nature
* **Ceremonial** - fit for weddings, funerals or other rituals
* **Storytelling** - telling great stories that inspire others
* **Emotional** - music that makes people laugh or weep
* **Concerto** - exquisite performance for the high classes

### Oratory
A booming voice, echoing through a large room, catches the attention of all. The oratory skill lets you say what needs to be said with a significant amount of panache.

### Pantomime
This is the ability to pantomime actions and have others understand what you're conveying, such as communicating with party members without resorting to whispering. The GM should set the DC according to how difficult that action would be to convey without any other items.

### Poetry
It's not for everyone but to the right target, Poetry is like the Massage skill for the soul.

### Singing
Functionally similar to playing an instrument but requiring an entirely different set of skills, singing is oft said to be one of the most difficult instruments to perfect.

## Persuasion Subskills

### Bargaining

Honest merchants prefer a fair bargain versus a cunning tongue. The best deals are the ones which benefit everyone. 

### Debate
You might be right, and they might be wrong, but if you don't understand the best way to express that then you'll truly have your work cut out for you.

### Etiquette 
While your usual skills of persuasion will work with the commoners, nobles and gentry will require a much more refined touch. That's when it's time to break out your Etiquette skills to impress.

### Leadership
Anyone can send a troupe of soldiers into battle. A leader will be there to inspire them to stay on the battlefield when the going gets tough, or to ignore their exhaustion when they're tired. The GM should set the DC based on how loyal that group is to the leader as well as what the leader is asking of that group.

### Provocation
Your cunning words cut deeper than your sword, and it is a fair reason to make anyone react angrily, violently, or emotionally against their best interests.

### Seduction
If you've got it, flaunt it. Of course there's no promise that you are what your target is looking for, but nothing ventured, nothing gained.
