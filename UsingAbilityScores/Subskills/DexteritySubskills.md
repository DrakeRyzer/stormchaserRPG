# Dexterity Subskills

## Acrobatics Subskills

### Aerobatics
Tumbling and swimming are great for players darting around foes on the ground and underwater, but Aerobatics helps airborne players do the same. GMs should set DCs similar to those skills for flying creatures.

### Balance
Crossing narrow bridges, riding choppy seas, or running across ice, most players actively avoid trying to fall prone.

### Diving
Sometimes a belly flop is fine, but most players want to avoid taking damage when falling into water. Slipping unnoticed into water to evade a dock guard might come in handy for port rogues.

### Escapology
Between spider webs and bounty hunter manacles, a quick Escape is sometimes the better part of valor.

### Tumbling
Avoiding damage from a big fall or sliding through an opponents legs, mobile characters often need to tumble.

## Sleight of Hand Subskills

### Concealment
While pickpocketing is great for liberating things from less observant targets, Concealment is great for making sure perceptive individuals aren't going to notice objects you've hidden. The GM should set the DC based on the size of the object and how difficult it would be to hide.

### Juggling
Whether catching something to prevent it from falling or entertaining a crowd, it's not an uncommon skill for those with quick reflexes to pick up. 

### Pickpocketing
Planting evidence or filling your pockets with the possessions of others, Pickpocketing is a staple in every major city.

## Stealth Subskills

### Camouflage
Camouflage is a great tool for staking out targets or keeping your party hidden while resting.

### Tailing
Wanting to move and not be noticed isn't just for Rogues. Keepers of Law or Bounty Hunters can find it useful for tracking targets. Either way, if you plan to move and be hidden Tailing is a useful skill to know.
