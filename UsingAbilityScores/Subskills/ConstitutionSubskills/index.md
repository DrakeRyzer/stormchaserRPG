# Constitution Subskills

## Athletics Subskills

### Distance Running
Sprinting short distances is fine, but sometimes players need to cover vast distances without rest. Distance Running allows you to maintain your pace. GMs should use Distance Running to allow players to cover greater distances overland than usual, with failure resulting in exhaustion.

### Environmental Adaptation
Over time, your body and mind have adapted to an environment. When using your Athletics skill to resist the naturally occurring effects of that terrain, you can use adaptation instead. For example, in a desert, you could use it to resist lack of water or overwhelming heat.

When picking this subskill, select one type of terrain or environment. You can take this expertise multiple times, selecting one new environment each time. The terrain available to Rangers via the Natural Explorer trait (*Player's Handbook*, pg. 91) are the options you can choose from, each time you take Environmental Adaptation expertise. 

* Arctic
* Coast
* Desert
* Forest
* Grassland
* Mountain
* Nautical
* Swamp
* Underdark
* Nautical

### Pain Tolerance
Information is power, and to that end torturers consider information extraction an art. Pain Tolerance allows you to resist their craft. The GM should use Athletics or Pain Tolerance as the skill to resist Torture.
