# Strength
Strength measures bodily power, athletic training and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

## Strength Checks
A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

### Athletics
Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:
* You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
* You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt mid-jump.
* You struggle to swim or slay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed.
* Another creature tries to push or pull you underwater, or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

#### Jumping
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

**Long Jump:** When you make a long jump, make a Strength (Athletics) check. You cover a number of feet equal to the result of your Strength (Athletics) check. If you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump, you cover *at least* a number of feet up to your Strength score. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap *at least* up to half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

**High Jump:** When you make a high jump, make a Strength (Athletics) check. You leap into the air a number of feet equal to the result of your Strength (Athletics) check divided by three. If you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump, you leap into the air *at least* a number of feet equal up to 3 + your Strength modifier. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump *at least* up to half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

### Other Strength Checks
The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like
the following:
* Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
* Break free of bonds
* Push through a tunnel that is too small
* Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
* Tip over a statue
* Keep a boulder from rolling

## Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

## Lifting and Carrying
Your Strength score determines the amount of weight that you can bear.

If you want to determine whether your character's gear is heavy enough to slow them down, total the weight of all the character's items, including armour, weapons, and gear. Compare this total to the character’s Strength on the Carrying Capacity table. Depending on the character's carrying capacity, they may be carrying a light, medium, or heavy load.
* A light load does not encumber a character.
* A medium load reduces a character's speed by 10 feet, limits their maximum Dexterity bonus to defence to +3, and imparts disadvantage on physical ability checks.
* A heavy load reduces a character's speed by 20 feet, limits their maximum Dexterity bonus to defence to +1, imparts disadvantage on physical ability checks and attack rolls, and grants advantage to attempts to hit the character's Strength and Dexterity defences.

A character can lift as much as their maximum load over their head. A character can lift as much as double their maximum load off the ground, but they can only stagger around with it. While overloaded in this way, the character loses any Dexterity bonus to defence and can move only 5 feet per round as an action. A character can generally push or drag along the ground as much as five times his maximum load. Favorable conditions can double these numbers, and bad circumstances can reduce them by half or more.

The numbers shown in the Carrying Capacity table are for Medium bipedal creatures. A larger bipedal creature can carry more weight depending on its size category, as follows: Large ×2, Huge ×4, Gargantuan ×8. A smaller creature can carry less weight depending on its size category, as follows: Small ×3/4, Tiny ×1/2.

Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than bipeds can. Multiply the values corresponding to the creature’s Strength score from Table: Carrying Capacity by the appropriate modifier, as follows: Tiny ×3/4, Small ×1, Medium ×1.5, Large ×3, Huge ×6, Gargantuan ×12.
