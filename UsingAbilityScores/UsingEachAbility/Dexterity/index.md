# Dexterity
Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

## Dexterity Checks
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

### Acrobatics
Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

#### Cross Narrow Surfaces/Uneven Ground
You can use Acrobatics to cross narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling. A successful check allows you to move at half speed across such surfaces. Use the following table to determine the base DC, which is modified by the second table below. A Dexterity (Acrobatics) check is only required to move across these surfaces if the final DC is 10 or higher.

While you are using Acrobatics in this way, melee and ranged attacks have advantage to hit you. If you take damage while using Acrobatics, you must make another check at the same DC to avoid falling or being knocked prone.

#### Falling
When you fall, a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check allows you to ignore the first 10 feet fallen, although you still end up prone if you take damage from a fall.

You can also negate damage when you fall off a mount. If you fail the Acrobatics check, you take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and are prone.

| Surface Width | Base Acrobatics DC |
|:-------------:|:------------------:|
| >3 feet wide | 0 |
| 1–3 feet wide | 5 |
| 7–11 inches wide | 10 |
| 2–6 inches wide | 15 |
| &#60;2 inches wide | 20 |

| Acrobatics Modifiers | DC Modifier |
|:--------------------:|:-----------:|
| Lightly Obstructed (gravel, sand) | +2 |
| Severely Obstructed (cavern, rubble) | +5 |
| Slightly Slippery (wet) | +2 |
| Severely Slippery (icy) | +5 |
| Slightly Sloped (&#60;45°) | +2 |
| Severely Sloped (>45°) | +5 |
| Slightly Unsteady (boat in rough water) | +2 |
| Mildly Unsteady (boat in a storm) | +5 |
| Severely Unsteady (earthquake) | +10 |
| Move at full speed | +5 |

### Sleight of Hand
Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

#### Tying Knots
The rules are purposely open-ended concerning mundane tasks like tying knots, but sometimes knowing how well a knot was fashioned is important in a dramatic scene when someone is trying to untie a knot or slip out of one.

The creature who ties the knot makes an Intelligence (Sleight of Hand) check when doing so. The total of the check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie the knot with an Intelligence (Sleight of Hand) check or to slip out of it with a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

This rule intentionally links Sleight of Hand with Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This is an example of how to apply the rule for skills with different abilities.

### Stealth
Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

#### Hiding
The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

**Passive Perception.** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 4. For disadvantage, subtract 4.

For example, if a character has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception (advantage), he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 16.

**What Can You See?** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured** as explained in Chapter 8.

#### Hiding While Invisible
Whilst invisible, you may forgo your movement to gain a second instance of advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide. If you also use your action to keep still and hold your breath, you gain a third instance of advantage. You must keep spending your action to maintain this increase.

#### Distraction
While you are hidden from a creature, you can throw a pebble or make a sound meant to confuse and distract them. You must be aware of the creature's approximate location or direction of movement. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Charisma (Performance) check depending on your distraction method, vs the creature's Passive Insight or Passive Investigation (the target chooses).

If you succeed, the creature is Distracted until the end of its next turn. Distracted creatures have disadvantage to Wisdom (Perception) checks and cannot use their Passive Perception.

If you fail, you must make a new Dexterity (Stealth) check with disadvantage against the target's Passive Perception.

### Other Dexterity Checks
The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

* Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
* Steer a chariot around a tight turn
* Pick a lock
* Disable a trap
* Securely tie up a prisoner
* Wriggle free of bonds
* Play a stringed instrument
* Craft a small or detailed object

## Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

## Initiative
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat, as described in Chapter 9.
