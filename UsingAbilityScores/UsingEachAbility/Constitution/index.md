# Constitution
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

## Constitution Checks
A Constitution check can model any attempt to push beyond normal limits.

### Athletics
Athletics checks are made when your character needs to push their bodies beyond normal limits. Holding your breath, marching for days, going without sleep or food, and resisting the effects of alcohol are all times when one would roll an Athletics check.

### Other Constitution Checks
The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
* Hold your breath
* March or labour for hours without rest
* Go without sleep
* Survive without food or water
* Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

## Stamina
In combination with your class multiplier, your Constitution score determines your stamina maximum.

If your Constitution score changes, your stamina maximum changes as well, as though you had the new score from character creation. For example, if you raise your Constitution score and your Constitution score increases from 13 to 14, you adjust your stamina maximum as though the score had always been 14. So you gain 1 stamina multiplied by your class multiplier. Or if some effect lowers your Constitution score, your stamina maximum is reduced in kind.
