# Constitution
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

## Constitution Checks
A Constitution check can model any attempt to push beyond normal limits.

### Endurance
Endurance checks are made when your character needs to push their bodies beyond normal limits. Holding your breath, marching for days, going without sleep or food, and resisting the effects of alcohol are all times when one would roll an endurance check.

### Other Constitution Checks
The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:
* Hold your breath
* March or labour for hours without rest
* Go without sleep
* Survive without food or water
* Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

## Stamina
Your Constitution modifier contributes to your stamina. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your stamina.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your stamina maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your stamina maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 stamina for your first three levels, and then roll your stamina for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your stamina maximum is reduced by 7.
