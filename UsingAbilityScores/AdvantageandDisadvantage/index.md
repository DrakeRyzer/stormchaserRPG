# Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If you have advantage on a damage roll, you similarly roll all the dice twice and take the better result.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you roll more than one additional d20. If two favourable situations grant advantage, for example, you roll two additional d20 and take the best of all three. Similarly, if two unfavourable situations grant disadvantage, you roll two additional d20 and take the *worst* of all three.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is *not* true if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and grants advantage in uneven amounts. In such a situation, one case of advantage cancels one case of disadvantage, and you are affected by whichever condition there is more of.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. [Inspiration](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/PersonalityandBackgrounds/Inspiration/) can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character's personality, ideals, or bonds. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

## Proficiency
Characters can [gain a proficiency die of advantage](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/StepbyStepCharacters/ChooseaClass/#proficiency) on attack rolls and ability checks. Monsters can also have this proficiency die, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus die is used in the rules on ability checks, attack rolls and defences.

Your proficiency die can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say that you can roll your proficiency bonus die when making a Wisdom check, you nevertheless add only one instance of advantage when you make the check.
