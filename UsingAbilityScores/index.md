# Using Ability Scores
Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

**Strength**, measuring physical power

**Dexterity**, measuring agility

**Constitution**, measuring endurance

**Intelligence**, measuring reasoning & memory

**Wisdom**, measuring perception & insight

**Charisma**, measuring force of personality

|   | Physical | Mental |
|:-:|:--------:|:------:|
| **Power** | Strength | Charisma |
| **Finesse** | Dexterity | Intelligence |
| **Resistance** | Constitution | Wisdom |

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities. They are both a creature's assets and its weaknesses.

The two main rolls of the game (the ability check and the attack roll) rely on the six ability scores. The introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

This section focuses on how to use ability checks, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls can be found [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/MakinganAttack/AttackRolls/).
