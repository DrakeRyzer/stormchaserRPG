# 3. Determine Ability Scores
Much of what your character does in the game depends on their six abilities: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom** and **Charisma**. Each ability has a score, which is a number that you record on your character sheet.

The six abilities and their use in the game are described in detail [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/UsingAbilityScores/). A quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability follows below:

* **Strength** measures athleticism and bodily power.
* **Dexterity** measures agility, reflexes, balance and poise.
* **Constitution** measures health, stamina and vital force.
* **Intelligence** measures acuity, recall and analytical skill.
* **Wisdom** measures awareness, intuition and insight.
* **Charisma** measures confidence and eloquence.

|   | Physical | Mental |
|:-:|:--------:|:------:|
| **Power** | Strength | Charisma |
| **Finesse** | Dexterity | Intelligence |
| **Resistance** | Constitution | Wisdom |

There are a number of different methods used to generate ability scores. Each of these methods gives a different level of flexibility and randomness to character generation.

Species modifiers are applied after the scores are generated.

After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down).

## Low Fantasy
Roll 3d6, rerolling all 1s, and add the dice together. Record the total and repeat the process until you have six numbers. Assign these results to your ability scores as you see fit.

This method is quite random, and some characters may have clearly superior abilities. This randomness can be taken one step further, with the totals applied to specific ability scores in the order they are rolled. Characters generated using this method are difficult to fit to predetermined concepts and are best designed around their ability scores.

If you don't like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can spend 25 points on the Ability Score Point Cost table, or use the **Low Fantasy Array** instead: 14, 13, 12, 12, 11, 10.

## Standard Fantasy
Roll 4d6. Discard the lowest die result and add the three remaining results together. Record the total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these totals to your ability scores as you see fit.

If you don't like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can spend 27 points on the Ability Score Point Cost table, or use the **Standard Array** instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

## High Fantasy
Roll 4d6, rerolling all 1s. Discard the lowest die result and add the three remaining results together. Record the total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these totals to your ability scores as you see fit.

This method is less random than Low Fantasy and tends to create characters with above-average ability scores.

If you don't like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can spend 40 points on the Ability Score Point Cost table, or use the **High Fantasy Array** instead: 16, 15, 14, 14, 13, 12.

## Customising Ability Scores
The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.

Your GM will tells you how many points you have to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 17 is the highest ability score that you can end up with, before applying racial increases, and 8 is the lowest.

This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones, a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal, or any set of numbers between those extremes.

##### Ability Score Point Cost

| Score | Cost | Score | Cost |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|
| 8 | 0 | 13 | 5 |
| 9 | 1 | 14 | 7 |
| 10 | 2 | 15 | 9 |
| 11 | 3 | 16 | 12 |
| 12 | 4 | 17 | 15 |
