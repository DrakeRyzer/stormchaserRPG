# 2. Choose a Class
Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talents they possess, and the tactics they are most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are **class features**. Capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of **proficiencies**: armour, weapons, skills, defences and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.

## Level
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining experience. A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although they might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.

Starting off at 1st level marks your character's entry into the adventuring life. If you're already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.

Record your level on your character sheet. If you're starting at a higher level, record the additional elements that your class gives you for your levels past 1st.

## Hit Points and Hit Dice
Your character's hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Constitution score and your class's hit point multiplier. You start with hit points equal to the product of these two numbers, as indicated in your class description. This is also your **hit point maximum**.

Record your character's hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see "Resting" in chapter 8).

## Proficiency Bonus
A proficiency bonus can be either a bonus d20 that is applied to a d20 roll as an instance of advantage, or a numerical bonus that is applied to a defence or other static score, such as your passive skill.

When a roll is made with proficiency, then roll 2d20 and keep the higher of the two. This applies to:
* Attack rolls using weapons that you're proficient with
* Attack rolls with spells that you cast
* Ability checks using skills that you're proficient in
* Ability checks using tools that you're proficient with

Your proficiency bonus to defences and other static scores is +4.

Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your defence proficiencies and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, tools in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional proficiencies and some species give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.

Proficiency cannot apply to a single die roll or other number more than once. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency applies more than once to the same roll, you nevertheless add it only once.
