# 2. Choose a Class
Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talents they possess, and the tactics they are most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Classes/).

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are **class features**. Capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of **proficiencies**: armour, weapons, skills, defences and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.

## Talents
Typically, a character starts with a single talent and advances by adventuring and gaining experience. A starting character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although they might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.

Starting off with one talent marks your character's entry into the adventuring life. If you're already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin with more talents, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.

Record your talents on your character sheet. If you're starting with additional talents, also record these.

## Stamina and Stamina Dice
Your character's stamina defines how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your stamina is determined by your Constitution score and your class's stamina multiplier. You start with stamina equal to the product of these two numbers, as indicated in your class description. This is also your **stamina maximum**.

Record your character's stamina on your character sheet. Also record the type of Stamina Die that your character uses and the number of Stamina Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Stamina Dice to regain stamina (see [Resting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/Resting/)).

## Proficiency
A proficiency bonus can be either a bonus d20 that is applied to a d20 roll as an instance of advantage, or a numerical bonus that is applied to a defence or other static score, such as your passive skill.

When a roll is made with proficiency, then roll with [advantage](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/UsingAbilityScores/AdvantageandDisadvantage.html). This applies to:
* Attack rolls using weapons that you're proficient with
* Attack rolls with spells that you cast
* Ability checks using defences, skills, or tools that you're proficient in

Your proficiency bonus to defences and other static scores is +4.

Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your defence proficiencies and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/UsingAbilityScores/AbilityChecks/Skills/) and tools [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Tools/).) Your background gives you additional proficiencies and some species give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies on your character sheet.

Proficiency cannot apply to a single die roll or other number more than once. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency applies more than once to the same roll, you nevertheless benefit only once.

### Expertise
Sometimes, a talent, feat or other feature might grant you expertise in a weapon, skill or tool that you are already proficient in. A character with expertise benefits from a second instance of advantage on their d20 roll. Additionally, passive scores that benefit from expertise increase by an additional +2, for a total of +6 together with the proficiency bonus.

### Mastery
Sometimes, a talent, feat or other feature might grant you mastery in a weapon, skill or tool that you are already an expert at. A character with mastery benefits from a third instance of advantage on their d20 roll. Additionally, passive scores that benefit from mastery increase by an additional +1, for a total of +7 together with the proficiency and expertise bonuses.

### Overrolling
When the exact total of a check is relevant (for example, when determining the quality of a crafted item), for every die beyond the first that makes the target DC, you gain a +1 to your final result. For every natural 20 beyond the first, you gain a +2 to your final result.
