# Beyond First Level
As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, they gain experience. Eventually, this leads to an advancement in capability called **gaining a level**.

## Class Features and Hit Dice
When your character gains a level, their class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores. You canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

## Wealth by Level
The Character Wealth by Level table lists the amount of treasure that each PC is expected to have at a specific level, in addition to their first level starting equipment from background and class.

Note that this table assumes a standard fantasy game. Low-fantasy games might award only half this value, while high-fantasy games might double the value. It is assumed that some of this treasure is consumed in the course of an adventure (such as potions and scrolls) and that some of the less useful items are sold for half value so more useful gear can be purchased.
