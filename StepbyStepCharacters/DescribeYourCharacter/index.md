# 4. Describe Your Character
Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it’s time to flesh them out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what they look like and how they behave in general terms.

Using the information in [Personality and Backgrounds](http://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/PersonalityandBackgrounds/), you can flesh out your character’s physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character’s **alignment** (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and **ideals**. This section also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called **bonds**, and the **flaws** that could one day undermine them.

Your character's **background** describes where they came from, their original occupation and their place in the world.

A background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit), a background feat and a number of character points, as described below.

## Character Points
When creating a character, you gain 6 character points from your background and a number of additional character points equal to your Intelligence modifier. These points are spent as described in the Character Point Costs table:

##### Character Point Costs

| Benefit | Cost |
|:-------:|:----:|
| Talent | 12 |
| Feat | 8 |
| Weapon Mastery | 4 |
| Skill Mastery | 4 |
| Increase an Ability Score by 1 (Max 20) | 4 |
| Weapon Expertise | 3 |
| Skill Expertise | 3 |
| Tool Mastery | 3 |
| Weapon Proficiency | 2 |
| Skill Proficiency | 2 |
| Tool Expertise | 2 |
| Cantrip | 2 |
| Subskill | 1 |
| Tool Proficiency | 1 |
| Language Proficiency | 1 |

* You can’t increase an ability score above 20.
* Expertise requires proficiency. Mastery requires expertise.
* Proficiencies granted by your class may be sacrificed in exchange for their equivalent value, which may be redistributed to another category.
* When you permanently increase your Intelligence modifier or your proficiency modifier, you may spend additional points as normal. Proficiencies learned by spending points cannot be lost once gained.

## Your Character's Abilities
Take your character’s ability scores and species into account as you flesh out their appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds to a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.

A character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.
